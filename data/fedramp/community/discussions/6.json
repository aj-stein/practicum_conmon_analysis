This technical assistance is intended to support Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and Third-Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs) in understanding and effectively applying the [DRAFT] FedRAMP Significant Change Notification Standard [RFC-0007](https://www.fedramp.gov/rfcs/0007/). It provides clarifications, a decision-making framework, and illustrative examples for determining the nature of changes (routine recurring, impact categorization, transformative, or adaptive) to cloud services.\r\n\r\nThis document is a supporting resource for the [DRAFT] Significant Change Notification Standard and is not intended to be used as a standalone document.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThe FedRAMP Authorization Act (44 USC \u00a7 3609 (a) (3)) directs GSA to develop technical assistance to support the authorization of cloud services. OMB Memorandum M-24-15 further emphasizes modernizing FedRAMP and leveraging commercial cloud innovations.\r\n\r\nThe [DRAFT] FedRAMP Significant Change Notification Standard (referenced in RFC-0007) introduces a new framework for how CSPs manage and report changes. To ensure consistent and effective implementation of this Standard, clear and practical guidance is essential. \r\n\r\nThis Significant Change Notification Technical Assistance document aims to:\r\n\r\n1. Provide Agencies, CSPs, and 3PAOs with the necessary context, examples, and decision-support material to confidently apply the Significant Change Notification Standard.\r\n2. Reduce ambiguity in interpreting terms like \"routine recurring,\" \"adaptive,\" and \"transformative\" changes within the context of diverse cloud services.\r\n3. Promote reasonable, defensible, and documented decision-making by CSPs regarding changes to their services.\r\n4. Support the overall FedRAMP goals of increasing the speed, effectiveness, and transparency of the authorization process, while ensuring robust security.\r\n5. Reinforce the principle that this guidance should facilitate informed discussions and not be misconstrued as a rigid compliance checklist.\r\n\r\n## Explanation\r\n\r\nThe full draft technical assistance is approximately 8 pages and is available for review in the following formats:\r\n\r\n- [Basic web formatting on fedramp.gov](https://fedramp.gov/updates/rfcs/0009)\r\n- Basic text markdown on GitHub (below)\r\n- PDF file: [rfc-0009-scn-technical-assistance.pdf](https://github.com/FedRAMP/rfcs/raw/main/rfc/assets/0009-scn-technical-assistance.pdf)\r\n- Word file: [rfc-0009-scn-technical-assistance.docx](https://github.com/FedRAMP/rfcs/raw/main/rfc/assets/0009-scn-technical-assistance.docx)\r\n\r\n## Discussion Requested\r\n\r\nThis draft technical assistance is open for any public comment. FedRAMP encourages informal comments from any member of the public. The public may submit multiple comments and may respond to other public comments. All comments from the public sent via email will be made public.\r\n\r\n- Are the examples provided for each change type (routine, transformative, adaptive) sufficiently illustrative and helpful, despite the caveats about not using them as definitive lists? Are there other common scenarios that would benefit from an example?\r\n- Is the guidance on determining what constitutes a \"major component or functionality\" for transformative changes clear enough to be consistently applied by reasonable people?\r\n- Does this technical assistance effectively support CSPs in developing reasonable, defensible, and documented justifications for their change categorizations?\r\n- Overall, does this technical assistance effectively achieve its stated aims of reducing ambiguity and supporting consistent application of the Significant Change Notification Standard (RFC-0007)?\r\n\r\nThe [FedRAMP Rev 5 Continuous Monitoring Working Group](https://www.fedramp.gov/20x/working-groups/rev5-monitoring/) will simultaneously host discussions on potential best practices and implementation of Significant Change Notifications based on this technical assistance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n# RFC-0009 Significant Change Notification Technical Assistance\r\n\r\nThursday, May 15th, 2025\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n[The FedRAMP Authorization Act (44 USC \u00a7 3609 (a) (3))](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2023-title44/USCODE-2023-title44-chap36-sec3609) directs the Administrator of the General Services Administration to *\u201cdevelop and publish templates, best practices, technical assistance, and other materials to support the authorization of cloud computing products and services and increase the speed, effectiveness, and transparency of the authorization process, consistent with standards and guidelines established by the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and relevant statutes.\u201d* This responsibility is [delegated to the FedRAMP Director](https://www.gsa.gov/directives-library/gsa-delegations-of-authority-fedramp). \r\n\r\n[OMB Memorandum M-24-15 on Modernizing FedRAMP](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Policy_Memo.pdf) section 2 states that *\u201cFedRAMP should not incentivize or require commercial cloud providers to create separate, dedicated offerings for Federal use, whether through its application of Federal security frameworks or other program operations. The Federal Government benefits from the investment, security maintenance, and rapid feature development that commercial cloud providers give to their core products to succeed in the marketplace.\u201d* \r\n\r\nThe FedRAMP Significant Change Notification Standard \\[DRAFT\\] states *\u201cAll parties SHOULD follow FedRAMP\u2019s best practices and technical assistance on significant change assessment and notification where applicable.\u201d*\r\n\r\n# Introduction\r\n\r\nThis document, Significant Change Notification Technical Assistance, is intended to support cloud service providers and third-party assessment organizations in adopting the Significant Change Notification Standard. \r\n\r\nEvery cloud service provider is different, every architecture is different, and every environment is different. Best practices and technical assistance MUST NOT be used as a checklist. All examples are for discussion purposes ONLY.\r\n\r\nThe Significant Change Notification Standard is designed for reasonable people to have reasonable discussions about changes that cloud services plan to make as they apply directly to their own specific cloud service. Cloud service providers are expected to employ competent technical security staff and involve them in product and engineering decisions to properly assess changes before, during, and after such changes. \r\n\r\nDecisions should be reasonable, defensible, and documented. The Significant Change Notification Standard should be used directly. This Technical Assistance provides additional background but is not intended to replace the Significant Change Notification Standard.\r\n\r\nThis Technical Assistance will be continuously expanded as the Significant Change Notification Standard is formalized, based on concerns raised during public comment and ongoing support and operations of FedRAMP. The RFC process may not apply to future versions.\r\n\r\n# Determining Significant Changes\r\n\r\nThe cloud service provider is solely responsible for determining when the FedRAMP Significant Change Notification Standard should be applied and for determining if a significant change is an adaptive change, transformative change, or impact categorization change. Cloud service providers do not need to consult with third-party assessment organizations if the provider determines the change is adaptive.\r\n\r\nThe simplest way to determine the type of significant change is to determine if it\u2019s a routine recurring change then work down from the highest impact change type:\r\n\r\n1. If a change is significant, is it a routine recurring activity?  \r\n2. If it is not, is it an impact categorization change?  \r\n3. If it is not, is it a transformative change?  \r\n4. If it is not, then it is an adaptive change.\r\n\r\nIn general, the vast majority of significant changes made by cloud service providers where the Significant Change Notification Standard applies will be adaptive changes. \r\n\r\n## Is it a routine recurring activity?\r\n\r\nActivities that are part of ongoing operations or vulnerability mitigation and remediation are NOT considered significant changes.\r\n\r\nThese types of activities are performed regularly and routinely by cloud service providers to address flaws or vulnerabilities, address incidents, and generally perform the typical maintenance expected during day-to-day operations. \r\n\r\nThese changes leverage mature processes and capabilities to identify, mitigate, and remediate risks as part of the change. Change management and incident response procedures of the cloud service provider are assessed during the Authority to Operate decision process by the agency customer(s).\r\n\r\n**Ongoing Operations:** Changes performed regularly and routinely without significant planning or oversight. \r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Key Tests:**\r\n\r\n* Routine \u201ccare and feeding\u201d by staff during normal duties  \r\n* Careful planning and/or project management NOT required  \r\n* No major impact to service availability\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Examples:**\r\n\r\n* Provisioning or deprovisioning capacity to support service elasticity  \r\n* Changing or tuning performance configurations for instances or services  \r\n* Updating and maintaining operational handling of information flows and protection across physical and logical networks (e.g., updating firewall rules)  \r\n* Generating or refreshing API or access tokens\r\n\r\n**Vulnerability mitigation and remediation:** Updates and patching performed on a routine basis to improve the security posture over time. \r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Key Tests:**\r\n\r\n* Minor, incremental patching or updates  \r\n* Significant refactoring or migration process NOT required  \r\n* No breaking changes\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Examples:**\r\n\r\n* Updating security service or endpoint signatures  \r\n* Routine patching of devices, operating systems, software or libraries  \r\n* Updating and deploying code that applies normal fixes and improvements as part of a regular development cycle  \r\n* Vulnerability remediation activity that simply replaces a known-bad component(s) with a better version of the exact same thing, running in the exact same way with no changes to processes\r\n\r\n# Significant Changes that Require Authorization Updates\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"impact-categorization-change\"></a>Is it an impact categorization change?\r\n\r\nImpact categorization changes are perhaps the simplest to identify in the current framework \\- if the intent of the change is to increase or decrease the FIPS 199 security categorization (impact level) *of the entire system* (such as from Low to Moderate or from High to Moderate) then it is an impact categorization change.\r\n\r\nImpact categorization changes require review and approval of either FedRAMP or a sponsoring agency and will lead to a re-authorization of the service at the new impact level. \r\n\r\n# Significant Changes that Require Notification \r\n\r\n## Is it a transformative change?\r\n\r\nChange that impacts major components or functionality and profoundly affects a cloud service offering is considered a transformative change.\r\n\r\n**Major components or functionality:** Components or capabilities critical and foundational to cloud service operations and risk profile. \r\n\r\n*NOTE: Major components or functionality is determined for the specific offering and a change that is transformative for one service may not be for another service.*\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Key Tests:**\r\n     \r\n* Alters the service's risk profile or require new or significantly different actions to address customer responsibilities  \r\n* Requires significant new design, development and testing with discrete associated project planning, budget, marketing, etc.  \r\n* Requires extensive updates to security assessments, documentation, and how a large number of security requirements are met and validated\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Examples:**\r\n     \r\n* The addition, removal, or replacement of a critical third party service that handles a significant portion of information (e.g., IaaS change)  \r\n* Increasing the security categorization of a service within the offering that actively handles federal information (does NOT include impact change of entire offering \\- see <A href=\"#impact-categorization-change\">impact categorization change</A>)  \r\n* Replacement of underlying management planes or paradigm shift in workload orchestration (e.g., bare-metal servers or virtual machines to containers, migration to kubernetes)  \r\n* Datacenter migration where large amounts of federal information is moved across boundaries different from normal day-to-day operations\r\n\r\n## Is it an adaptive change?\r\n\r\nChange that is not routine, does not change the impact categorization of the service offering and does not greatly impact major components or functionality (transformative change) is considered an adaptive change.\r\n\r\n**Service adjustments:** Iterative adjustments to existing components or functionality which is not routine, but not a complete redesign or overhaul.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Key Tests:**\r\n     \r\n* Requires few changes to security plans or procedures  \r\n* Requires some careful planning and project management to implement, but doesn\u2019t rise to the level of planning required for transformative changes  \r\n* Requires verification of existing functionality and secure configuration after implementation\r\n     \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Examples:**\r\n     \r\n* Updates to operating systems, containers, virtual machines, software or libraries with known breaking changes, complex steps, or service disruption  \r\n* Deploying larger than normal incremental feature improvements in code or libraries that are the work of multiple weeks of development efforts but aren\u2019t considered a major new service  \r\n* Changing cryptographic modules where the new module meets the same standards and characteristics of the former  \r\n* Replacing a like-for-like component where some security plan or procedure adjustments are required (e.g., scanning tool or managed database swap)",

      "body": "Here's a few examples which I think are worth walking through (and updating the tech assistance to clarify this with less subjectivity).  I've taken a stab at applying them, but there's still some wiggle room.\r\n\r\n1) Replacement of local Active Directory with Okta for SSO/IDP functionality:\r\n- On one hand, it'd be a new design, changes the management plan, and have significant updates to assessments, etc.  It definitely affects the controls.  That would be Transformative or is it?\r\n- On the other hand, it doesn't substantially change the flow, just where there authentication/authorization occurs.  Or is that more replacing a like-for-like component?  \r\n- On the third hand (because I have 3 hands... I wish, because I'd be a way better drummer), let's say I approach this as an Adaptive and get 3PAO buy in.  What if FedRAMP/Agency disagrees, possibly initially, althought perhaps months later down the line.  I have actually seen a scenario of this in pre-20x where FedRAMP opted to impose some punitive measures (which, by the way, I didn't agree with, and were NOT appealable) because they (months later) didn't agree with a good faith determination that a given change was not significant.  \r\n\r\nMy take: Adaptive\r\n\r\nMigration from a VM based structure to a container based structure (this one only has two hands, thankfully!) Let's assume a relatively innocuous application function, like a customized report generator for the application itself was originally running on linux hosts.  As part of a new architecture, this will be replaced with a containerized model for report generation.  Also, it will set the stage for migrating future application functional modules from VMs to containers.\r\n- Hand Number One, the Transformative Hand: Significant new design, and \"paradigm shift in workload orchestration\"\r\n- Hand Number Two, the Adaptive Hand: Is similarly a like-for-like component swap, and really just requires verification of existing functionality and secure configuration\r\n- Ok, I do have a Third Hand here after all:  Would the first 'migration to containers' be deemed Transformative, but future migrations be considered Adaptive.   Does this iteration matter.  In the long haul, everything would eventually be containerized?  Or a variant.  Consider that we've already migrated functions X and Y a few months prior.  This report generator module would be our third.  Does that change things, because the paradigm shift has already occurred?\r\n\r\nMy take: first one is Transformative, subsequent ones are Adaptive.  Although I wouldn't argue with a fully Adaptive designation.\r\n\r\nMigrating a key application database that absolutely contains government data from self hosted mySQL on our own VM to platform based IaaS service (e.g. RDS instance or Azure Database for MySQL).\r\n- It's a major component with government data, which puts this in the Transformative camp.\r\n- But it's about as clean of a like-for-like anyway, and it's on a FedRAMP authorized IaaS and if anything, probably makes this as easy as it gets.  \r\n\r\nMy take: probably Adaptive, but bordering on Routine.\r\n\r\nIn all three cases, though, I could see different justifications for a different change level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n",

          "body": "thanks for these examples @jsantore-cgc \r\n\r\nMy take is that in any case, there are many factors that could impact how significant a change is, so I would treat any examples as rules of thumb rather than hard guidelines.\r\n\r\n1. That feels adaptive to me too. part of it is that okta security is already well established and mapped out within FedRAMP so the risk is pretty well quantified and, I would argue, mitigated.\r\n2. . I think you are on the right track here as well. If a CSP is doing a large migration from VM-to-container, the full change will likely span a long period of time, and there will certainly be at least some parts of the offering that are still not containerized. It may depend what machines are being migrated, how big the project is, and how it changes the controls themselves. So I could see routine container conversions all the way through transformative (and in fact, I have considered impact changes of which containerization played a key role, so there are situations where it could be stretched to be a major part of even impact change decisions.)\r\n3. I like what you are thinking here as well. The risk for that IaaS service is already quantified and qualified - the biggest thing I see is making sure the customer knows where their data is hosted, otherwise, its not clear what part of the change is actually significant.",

      "body": "The draft guidance is a welcome and thoughtful addition to the evolving FedRAMP modernization effort. The categorization framework (routine recurring, adaptive, transformative, impact categorization) provides a pragmatic decision model that reflects how modern DevSecOps teams build, deploy, and iterate on cloud services. It also aligns with industry expectations around secure product lifecycle management without overburdening teams with unnecessary process.\r\n\r\nFeedback:\r\n\r\n1. More Examples Needed for Modern Cloud-native Architectures\r\nThe provided examples are helpful, but they lean toward traditional VM- and IaaS-centric models.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: Include examples related to:\r\n\r\n1. Infrastructure-as-Code pipeline changes (e.g., Terraform refactors)\r\n2. GitOps-based configuration changes (e.g., ArgoCD manifest swaps)\r\n3. Container orchestration system upgrades (e.g., Kubernetes major version upgrade or shift in CNI)\r\n\r\nThese cases are common in cloud-native SaaS and often fall into a gray zone between adaptive and transformative without further context.\r\n\r\n2. Clarify \u201cMajor Component or Functionality\u201d\r\nThe distinction between adaptive vs. transformative changes hinges on the phrase \"major component or functionality,\" but this can be highly subjective.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: Consider referencing service-criticality categories (e.g., FIPS-199 high-value assets, impact to AC/IA/SC families in NIST 800-53) or risk tiering (e.g., systems supporting PII processing or inter-agency workflows) to help assess whether a change is transformative.\r\n\r\n3. Address CSP Accountability for Internal Change Classification\r\nThe guidance rightfully states CSPs are responsible for categorizing changes and documenting decisions. However, many sponsoring agencies and 3PAOs continue to expect review or approval of even adaptive changes.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: Clarify that adaptive changes do not require prior approval and offer a sample decision log template CSPs can use to track, justify, and communicate change classifications in a defensible manner.\r\n\r\n4. Reinforce Separation of Change Notification from Authorization Updates\r\nThe guidance correctly distinguishes transformative and impact categorization changes (which require FedRAMP review) from routine/adaptive changes. However, some stakeholders conflate notification with reauthorization.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: Emphasize that change notifications do not automatically require a full security assessment package update unless the change affects authorization conditions or control inheritance.\r\n\r\n5. Encourage OSCAL or Structured Change Logs\r\nTo improve transparency and automation in the continuous monitoring process, change classification metadata (e.g., change type, date, affected component, rationale) should be structured and machine-readable.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: Reference OSCAL component and implementation layers or a JSON/YAML schema format for tracking change logs that can be reused across agencies and 3PAOs.",

Are there other common scenarios that would benefit from an example?\r\n\r\n> Snowflake Response:\r\n> - Examples including AI service offerings should be considered. Many service providers are building AI capabilities within their products and they could benefit from clear examples of where these additional offerings can be considered adaptive or transformative changes. AI could potentially be considered a transformative change based on the effect it can have on how customers may use a particular service (front end).

If a non-CSP stakeholder adjudicates that a change is actually transformative, how will that impact the implementation of the change while the need for a Significant Change is being coordinated across stakeholders?\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, does this technical assistance effectively achieve its stated aims of reducing ambiguity and supporting consistent application of the Significant Change Notification Standard (RFC-0007)?\r\n\r\n> Snowflake Response: \r\n> - Yes, with the exception of the few comments, questions, and requests for clarity around examples identified by Snowflake within this response.",

      "body": "Again, thankyou for the time and care you invested to create this document.\r\n\r\n### General Thoughts\r\n\r\nOverall, I still have a concern that the significant change standard and the technical guidance is drifting away from the mark of security impact to the system and drifting toward the size of the change. While the two are interrelated, the outcomes of certain cases can be very different.\r\nAs tangible parallel, if I am managing a physical warehouse, and I decide to rearrange all of the inventory onto new shelves to make it 20% more efficient, this would be a sizeable project, but it has no bearing on the security of the warehouse, aside from perhaps changing inventory audit procedure order.\r\nUsing the same example, if I decided to rekey the locks to the warehouse with a vanilla un-carved key, this innocuous move has massive security impact and should have more scrutiny.\r\nBringing this back to computer information systems, if a company does a massive ui overhaul using new styles, it could take months of planning and execution but have negligible security impact.\r\nI would like to make sure that in all instances we are indexing to the risk of the change, not to the size of the change. I detect some drift in this document.\r\n\r\nI would also like to reiterate my appreciation for avoiding over-specificity. Because code needs to be taken in context of a code base which needs to be in context of a system, which is part of an operational capability run by a company providing a service in an ecosystem, etc. etc. the unique circumstances of a given change need to be respected for Cloud to deliver on its promises. While it is clear that guidelines are necessary, over-specificity is much more dangerous to the core mission of FedRAMP by killing innovation and cutting out new entrants with new architectures (if there is any doubt, just reference FedRAMP\u2019s original published ABDs with current architecture diagrams. If they had locked down hard on their reference architecture, they would have also excluded most new microservice architectures)\r\n\r\n### Section Comments\r\n\r\n> The Significant Change Notification Standard is designed for reasonable people to have reasonable discussions about changes that cloud services plan to make as they apply directly to their own specific cloud service.

Cloud service providers do not need to consult with third-party assessment organizations if the provider determines the change is adaptive.\r\n\r\nThese two paragraphs may be the most important part of this document.\r\n\r\n**Routine Recurring activity notes**\r\n\r\n-\tExamples are helpful, thank you\r\n-\tI would expand these examples more broadly. I know there is another side that really loves detailed lines drawn, but when I look at these examples, these still appear to reference a non-dynamic, non Dev-ops oriented, non-micro-service architecture system. In these types of systems, updates are expected, and routinely delivered tens, hundreds, or even thousands of updates a day. These updates are not simply quashing bugs or mitigating vulnerabilities. They are creating and testing micro improvements to the product, making life better to the customer in response to signal that something isn\u2019t optimized. \r\n\r\nOf the examples given under \u2018ongoing operations (Is it a routine recurring activity),\r\n\r\n> Provisioning or deprovisioning capacity to support service elasticity\r\n\r\n-\tProvisioning or deprovisioning capacity, while certainly routine in a legacy system, is usually automated in a modern architecture \u2013 the csp doesn\u2019t even log this as a change since they took no action, instead, the system will respond dynamically and write actions to logging and monitoring in case something goes wrong.\r\n\r\n> Changing or tuning performance configurations for instances or services\r\n\r\n-\tChanging or tuning performance configurations, while interpretable as a broad umbrella, is written more toward adjusting metrics from code and components already deployed rather than deploying new change requests for code and components. Almost all routine changes are deploying code of some sort. While infrastructure changes may be closer to this \u2018configuration\u2019 wording if you consider templates as a configuration file, application changes that should fit under this umbrella don\u2019t seem to be covered.\r\n\r\n> Updating and maintaining operational handling of information flows and protection across physical and logical networks (e.g., updating firewall rules)\r\n\r\n-\tUpdating and maintaining operational handling of information flows etc. also could be considered as a larger umbrella, but the example of updating firewall rules is once again much more minimal than the majority of routine changes.\r\n\r\n> Generating or refreshing API or access tokens\r\n\r\n-\tGenerating or refreshing api or access tokens is also extremely minimal \u2013 these can be automated or sent through an approval flow, as opposed to a configurable deploy change.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoint 3 under **vulnerability mitigation** and remediation appears to cover these many minor code changes that I am referring to, but the changes themselves would be greater than just \"vulnerability mitigation\".\r\nIf all of the hundreds or thousands of code changes were to fall under an adaptive change, the agencies would get something closer to a logging stream than a change notification. That won\u2019t just be an inconvenience, it will cause significant overhead for routine changes and will cause a chilling effect to occur where companies will become less responsive and much slower. I don\u2019t believe agencies would appreciate that situation either.\r\nMy guess is that routine changes will expected be more broad than that.\r\n\r\n**Recommendation: expand the examples to include the day-to-day deploys of cloud-native companies**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Routine Recurring activity notes**\r\nclear rules for a clear change type. Short and sweet. Thanks\r\n\r\n\r\n**Transformateive change**\r\nno comments\r\n\r\n\r\n**Adaptive change**\r\n I especially appreciate the last two examples \u2013 swapping out something that, while in isolate could be considered to be of significant security impact, which functions the same as a component that was already in place. As a result, the change impact  in the context of the system security state before and after is negligible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Clarification of Routine Recurring Activities<br><br>Routine recurring activities should be explicitly confirmed as out of scope for Significant Change Notifications. This includes activities such as regular patching, performance tuning, and operational maintenance that are part of day-to-day cloud service operations. Clarifying this in guidance helps prevent over-reporting and supports operational efficiency while preserving security intent.<br><br><br>2\\. Refinement of Change Classification Criteria<br><br>The classification of changes should rely strictly on technical and security impact. References to planning elements such as project budgets or marketing should be removed to avoid confusion. The focus should remain on whether a change affects the system\u2019s risk profile, core functionality, or authorization boundary.<br><br><br>3\\. Definitions for Key Terms<br><br>Several terms would benefit from greater precision to reduce interpretive variability.<br><br>\\* \"Of information\" references: Should be explicitly interpreted as referring to federal information.<br><br>Where possible, reinforcing these definitions in this document would support consistent implementation. AWS acknowledges that some areas, such as the interpretation of \u201csecurity assessments\u201d and related requirements, may be better clarified by FedRAMP directly, rather than through CSP interpretation.<br><br>4\\. Scope of Impact Categorization Changes<br><br>Clarification is requested around how to handle increases or decreases in categorization within a portion of a system. While the document notes that changes impacting overall FIPS 199 categorization will lead to reauthorization, it remains unclear how partial changes\u2014such as raising the categorization of a feature or capability\u2014should be treated. Further examples would help illustrate how to distinguish between changes that require reauthorization versus notification.<br><br><br>5\\. Adaptive Changes and Use of Third-Party Software<br><br>Adding or removing third-party or open-source components, including pre-approved internal-use libraries, is considered an adaptive change provided it does not fundamentally alter the existing architecture or require major changes to existing security controls. This aligns with AWS\u2019s previously proposed definition of adaptive change and reflects common development practices in large-scale cloud environments. Including this clarification directly in the technical assistance document would help ensure consistent understanding and reduce unnecessary notifications.<br><br><br>6\\. Thresholds for Security Plan Updates<br><br>The phrase \u201cfew changes to security plans or procedures\u201d would benefit from clearer terminology. We recommend using the term \u201cminimal changes\u201d to better reflect the security impact of such updates. For example, AWS considers small textual edits to SSP documentation, such as rewording control implementation narratives for clarity or updating administrative contact information, to be minimal changes. These do not affect architecture or the functionality of security controls and fall within the scope of adaptive changes.<br><br>Conversely, updates or additions that impact system architecture, control applicability, or customer responsibilities would likely exceed this threshold and may require reclassification. While the intent is to provide decision space to CSPs, offering examples of what qualifies as minimal supports consistent interpretation and implementation.<br> |                           |\r\n| 6/4/2025 9:05:58   | Palantir                  | Cloud Service Provider (CSP)  | Overall I think RFC-0009 Significant Change Notification Technical Assistance is very well written and all looks great.<br><br>My only comment is this line below.

We recommend that Agencies should be the authorizer for these, as they are the ones who will ultimately accept the risk of not going through a formal sig change assessment.<br>\\-Common scenarios that would benefit from an example: Infrastructure as code pipeline changes, major container version upgrades, adding new products/services into scope that don't majorly change the underlying infrastructure or in scope components, etc.<br>\\-Define \"Major Component or Functionality\" as referenced in the transformative change section.

The other side of this is that when you do apply this you risk having punitive action taken against you with the case of fed ramp disagreeing with your verdict on the SCN.<br><br>Given these uncertainties, I anticipate many CSPs will adopt a conservative approach, defaulting to traditional change submission processes to mitigate risk. Without clearer guidelines and assurances, the intended benefits of this reform may not be fully realized, as organizations prioritize caution over the operational efficiencies this change is meant to enable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                           |",
