      "body": "Hello, @sunstonesecure-robert, thanks for your submission. I am reviewing the OSCAL content. See caveats at the bottom.\r\n\r\n# General Feedback on OSCAL content\r\n\r\n## Catalogs are for control requirements, not key security indicators\r\n\r\nPer [OSCAL v1.1.3's catalog documentation](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL-Reference/models/v1.1.3/catalog/json-outline/), a catalog must have one or more groups, one or more controls, and any group must have at least one control. Although the schema validation is complete, JSON Schema has known limitations in enforcing a requirement this complex with conditional adjacent data elements. The example catalog is syntatically valid, but fails to meet this requirement. Additionally, the KSIs in RFC0006 are indicators, not controls, so I consider this a suboptimal use of a catalog. Beyond the mandatory use of controls not necessary for 20x use cases, there are a variety of complex requirements for an OSCAL catalog that require additional data fields to be valid for OSCAL's core constraints. How will you coordinate with upstream maintainers to change these core requirements to account for 20x not requiring them for FedRAMP use cases?\r\n\r\n## Assessment Plans Import System Security Plans Not Required for 20x\r\n\r\nWith my facilitator hat off, I personally agree assessment plans and results are generally applicable to 20x criteria and approach. However, the [current normative schema and documentation of OSCAL assessment plans require a system security plan](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL-Reference/models/v1.1.3/assessment-plan/json-reference/#/assessment-plan/import-ssp). 20x, however, does not require a system security plan. You provided [a dummy SSP that does not is a valid file](https://github.com/SunStone-Secure-LLC/artemis-fedramp20x/blob/01b9cc5907a7cd61f1bb340becf316acbd8acf8e/KSIs/assessment-plan-KSI-CNA.json#L46-L49) for `import-ssp`. How will you properly handle the SSP in future phases of the pilot and a possible production workflow in the future? As this disparity appears to be part of the design of current OSCAL models, how will you coordinate with upstream maintainers to change this core requirement to account for 20x not requiring a SSP (or at least analogous data that will be structured very differently and not conform to the OSCAL SSP v1.1.3 model)?\r\n\r\n## Custom URI scheme handler without implementation guidance\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing the data conforming to the `assessment-results` model, I see multiple uses of a URI scheme (`evidence://`) for various attachments of `related-evidence`, such as [this example with CSV data for monthly scanning coverage](https://github.com/SunStone-Secure-LLC/artemis-fedramp20x/blob/01b9cc5907a7cd61f1bb340becf316acbd8acf8e/KSIs/assessment-result-KSI-CNA.json#L359-L363). This scheme is not officially registered in the [formal IANA registry for these schemes](https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml) does not include `evidence://` to map the scheme to a formal specification. Search engines and chatbots did not point me to anything in particular. How would a downstream 3PAO or customer agency leverage this custom scheme? Do you have implementation guidance or intend to product it in the future?\r\n\r\n# Precise Feedback on OSCAL content validation\r\n\r\n## Methodology\r\n\r\nTo perform the analysis with the associated files, I downloaded and installed the latest version of [metaschema-framework/oscal-cli](https://github.com/metaschema-framework/oscal-cli), [v2.5.1](https://github.com/metaschema-framework/oscal-cli/releases/tag/v2.5.1), on a MacBookPro18,3 workstation with a Apple M1 Pro processor and 16GB of LPDDR5 memory. I used the `time` and `find` commands to execute a loop validation pass with the CLI on each artifact that was a document instance of a known OSCAL model (e.g. I filtered out `summary-*.json` files with the `find` command).\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nAll five OSCAL files are [well-formed, but only one is schema valid](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/learn/concepts/validation/). Due to schema validation issues, primarily because fields that require UUIDs use temporary placeholder data that are not, so higher order constraint validation fails. There are some high-level issues with the use of the Assessment Layer models (e.g. `assessment-plan` and `assessment-results`, see the [general feedback section](#general-feedback-on-oscal-content) for more details.\r\n\r\n## Schema Validation\r\n\r\nTo test schema validation, I executed the following commands on the workstation described above, receiving the following output.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/SunStone-Secure-LLC/artemis-fedramp20x.git\r\n$ pushd /home/me/artemis-fedramp20x\r\n$ git rev-parse HEAD\r\n01b9cc5907a7cd61f1bb340becf316acbd8acf8e\r\n$ /opt/oscal-cli/bin/oscal-cli --version\r\noscal-cli 2.5.1 built at 2025-05-16 13:30 from branch 54e314549f7d0b8a8a3b4954637b0a511add6376 (54e3145) at https://github.com/metaschema-framework/oscal-cli\r\nliboscal-java 5.2.1 built at 2025-05-15 19:10 from branch a7ee006bfe0870093a2366deec922e3f5e74cfc2 (a7ee006) at https://github.com/metaschema-framework/liboscal-java\r\noscal  built at 2025-05-15 19:10 from branch b39789e5ab6df36dbe14f481e40113b91fd25f3f (b39789e) at https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL.git\r\nmetaschema-java 2.2.0 built at 2025-04-06T04:07:49+0000 from branch 49988340b9ce3283010f14a32280aa75e008d4e7 (4998834) at https://github.com/metaschema-framework/metaschema-java\r\nmetaschema 2.2.0 built at 2025-04-06T04:07:49+0000 from branch c07df88065f3e34e22f19d1330d6b437c24b7237 (c07df88) at https://github.com/metaschema-framework/metaschema.git\r\n$ find '.' -iname '*.json' ! -iname 'summary*.json' -exec time /opt/oscal-cli/bin/oscal-cli validate {} -o {}.schema_only.sarif --disable-constraint-validation \\;\r\nValidating 'file://home/me/artemis-fedramp20x/KSIs/assessment-result-KSI-SC.json' as JSON.\r\nThe file 'file://home/me/artemis-fedramp20x/KSIs/assessment-result-KSI-SC.json' is invalid.\r\n        1.48 real         1.86 user         0.14 sys\r\nValidating 'file://home/me/artemis-fedramp20x/KSIs/assessment-plan-KSI-SC.json' as JSON.\r\nThe file 'file://home/me/artemis-fedramp20x/KSIs/assessment-plan-KSI-SC.json' is invalid.\r\n        1.09 real         1.76 user         0.09 sys\r\nValidating 'file://home/me/artemis-fedramp20x/KSIs/assessment-result-KSI-CNA.json' as JSON.\r\nThe file 'file://home/me/artemis-fedramp20x/KSIs/assessment-result-KSI-CNA.json' is invalid.\r\n        1.13 real         1.78 user         0.09 sys\r\nValidating 'file://home/me/artemis-fedramp20x/KSIs/assessment-plan-KSI-CNA.json' as JSON.\r\nThe file 'file://home/me/artemis-fedramp20x/KSIs/assessment-plan-KSI-CNA.json' is invalid.\r\n        1.09 real         1.80 user         0.08 sys\r\nValidating 'file://home/me/artemis-fedramp20x/lib/catalog-KSI-SC.json' as JSON.\r\nThe file 'file://home/me/artemis-fedramp20x/lib/catalog-KSI-SC.json' is valid.\r\n        1.08 real         1.73 user         0.10 sys\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease see the attached SARIF reports for precise information about the errors, but for the four invalid files (of the total five), there are more than 1,000 error findings. (NOTE: There are summary findings and some redundancy, possible bugs in the tools, but I reviewed many of them in the course of an hour and many appear to be valid). The relevant files [in the associated Gist](https://gist.github.com/aj-stein-gsa/2c2ad782e7644b6825a418d3c0c95b9c/) all end with `.schema_only.sarif` to distinguish them from the other tests.\r\n\r\n## Core OSCAL Validations\r\n\r\nTo test schema and constraints internal to the officially released OSCAL v1.1.3 models from NIST, I run a modified version of the previous test harness to apply [constraint validation](https://pages.nist.gov/metaschema/specification/syntax/constraints/) in addition to basic schema validation, if possible. As before, four of the five total files failed constraint validation because of related foundational schema validation errors. The fifth catalog file did not pass validation with 120 error findings. I am including this file below with the extension `.schema_plus_validation.sarif` in [the associated Gist with this file](https://gist.github.com/aj-stein-gsa/2c2ad782e7644b6825a418d3c0c95b9c/).\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/SunStone-Secure-LLC/artemis-fedramp20x.git\r\n$ pushd /home/me/artemis-fedramp20x\r\n$ git rev-parse HEAD\r\n01b9cc5907a7cd61f1bb340becf316acbd8acf8e\r\n$ /opt/oscal-cli/bin/oscal-cli --version\r\noscal-cli 2.5.1 built at 2025-05-16 13:30 from branch 54e314549f7d0b8a8a3b4954637b0a511add6376 (54e3145) at https://github.com/metaschema-framework/oscal-cli\r\nliboscal-java 5.2.1 built at 2025-05-15 19:10 from branch a7ee006bfe0870093a2366deec922e3f5e74cfc2 (a7ee006) at https://github.com/metaschema-framework/liboscal-java\r\noscal  built at 2025-05-15 19:10 from branch b39789e5ab6df36dbe14f481e40113b91fd25f3f (b39789e) at https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL.git\r\nmetaschema-java 2.2.0 built at 2025-04-06T04:07:49+0000 from branch 49988340b9ce3283010f14a32280aa75e008d4e7 (4998834) at https://github.com/metaschema-framework/metaschema-java\r\nmetaschema 2.2.0 built at 2025-04-06T04:07:49+0000 from branch c07df88065f3e34e22f19d1330d6b437c24b7237 (c07df88) at https://github.com/metaschema-framework/metaschema.git\r\n$ find '.' -iname '*.json' ! -iname 'summary*.json' -exec time /opt/oscal-cli/bin/oscal-cli validate {} -o {}.schema_plus_constraints.sarif \\;\r\nValidating 'file:/home/me/artemis-fedramp20x/KSIs/assessment-result-KSI-SC.json' as JSON.\r\njava.io.IOException: Malformed data 'c3a0b1a0-8d70-4e6a-9a0f-0c1d2e3f4g5h' in 'file:/home/me/artemis-fedramp20x/KSIs/assessment-result-KSI-SC.json' at '26:20'.

Separate of my previous upstream feedback, I see little to no contribution to the former, so I closed my own change proposals as it pertained to pre-20x FedRAMP needs, and I opted to stop voluntary upstream contributions to the NIST projects altogther. Aside from events pages on the website, the projects seem to be dead (albeit not archived).\r\n\r\nI bring this up because it seems, to me, a critical blocker to OSCAL data for adoption _specifically for 20x_ is the current v1.1.3 models, as-is, are too purpose-fit for NIST's RMF-based 800-53 control and assessment methodology and won't work for this use case. I both have given and received this feedback here and at NIST and at GSA over the last two years, so it would seem there has been no progress on short-term or long-term resolution on it.\r\n\r\nHow will you provide OSCAL data for 20x requirements and not provide incorrect or extraneous data, given the high-level feedback in my initial response? Those are two obvious areas, re precise feedback I can think of quite a few more, but it means something needs to change short-term for others to socialize and support this approach.\r\n\r\nI know that is deep, complex feedback given the submission, but it would be nice to know if there is a plan for that.

The exceptions thrown with constraints indicate parse failures. That's ok to start, but the normative requirements of core OSCAL would require complex workarounds for relevant data, same for extraneous data that is not need to parse and validate. If FedRAMP data engineers were to write software to process this data, and even do so securely in an isolated pre-production environment, I have to put it aside for further exceptions and need to delay for human review because the content throws exceptions in that environment.\r\n\r\nSo far as that goes, that doesn't work for me now. Let me know if you have questions about the output and how we can parse, validate, or both. Let me know if you need help with the SARIF output.\r\n\r\n",
