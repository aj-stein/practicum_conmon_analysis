# Post

We've replaced the 20x Phase One (20xP1) page yet again, this time with information on the 20xP1 authorization process - including requirements, how to submit, what to submit, and what to expect:

https://www.fedramp.gov/20x/phase-one/

**You can use this thread to ask questions about the pilot, discuss the content, or just get hype in general.** My team and I will be engaging frequently. 

If you have questions about the Key Security Indicators or the Minimum Assessment Scope, [there's a thread for that here too](https://github.com/FedRAMP/community/discussions/28).
