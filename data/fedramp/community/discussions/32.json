  "body": "**Paramify** has published a 20x Phase One Pilot Draft Submission available at: \r\n**https://github.com/paramify/fedramp-20x-pilot** \r\n\r\n**Summary of 20x Draft Submission**\r\nParamify's draft submission focuses on the method used to track and assess KSIs, generate a machine readable package, continuously monitor and report on implementation status and issues. As a draft, this submission does not constitute a complete, finalized package, but is intended to demonstrate our process and solicit feedback on improvements to meet the goals of FedRAMP 20x. The proposed YAML machine-readable schema is available for review and feedback. Paramify is working with Schellman as 3PAO. We look forward to the community's feedback! \r\n\r\n\r\n[Edit] Kenny made me add this \r\n![2302fd40-cfed-4683-9101-92f15ff6bff5_1080x1080](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e66b1f4f-332b-48f9-9018-2e2c87108970)",
