We are being intentionally open ended as we want to see what gets presented or included in a package during the pilots.\r\n\r\nThe high-level process as outlined on the [Phase One Pilot](https://www.fedramp.gov/20x/phase-one/) identifies that a SOC2 Type 2 report itself could be used as evidence for KSI validation - [Draft standards for KSIs](https://www.fedramp.gov/rfcs/0006/)\r\n\r\nWhile we would like technical and machine readable evidence to the greatest extent possible, there may be situations where this is very challenging or not possible. If applicable information was already evaluated for the purpose of an audit, we would like to be able to reuse.\r\n\r\nWe haven't mapped anything specifically to the KSIs and aren't looking at full reciprocity, so for the purpose of the pilot, the CSP and/or 3PAO would determine if the audit report contains enough information to validate part or all of a KSI and submit with their package.",

          "body": "Thank you for the clarification. In order for a 3PAO to do this for any commercial framework, they will need to review the evidence (machinery readable or not) that was provided for the SOC 2 Type 2 audit (or insert any other framework) and see which KSI it would meet. I know we keep saying no mapping or reciprocity, but this still seems like the 3PAO would evaluate evidence and map it to the correct KSI.\r\n\r\nIf the evidence still needs to be evaluated by a 3PAO, then how would this be any different than a traditional FedRAMP audit? Audit firms that perform a SOC 2 Type 2 audit and FedRAMP audit for the same company have already been leveraging evidence amongst their audit teams where possible. \r\n\r\nI think if commercial frameworks are going to be leveraged, there will need to be some level of reciprocity or mapping where a 3PAO does not have to re-review evidence.",

If a CSP has to pay an auditor for SOC 2 or any other framework and then has to pay a second time to a 3PAO so the evidence can be validated, then I think that is counterproductive to the intent of easing the burden to attain an ATO. There has to be a level of trust in the merits of the commercially available framework in order for this to work. ",

In my opinion, the review time will only be reduced if they don\u2019t have to review the evidence because the 3PAO can determine that the KSI is already met since it was tested during another framework\u2019s audit and they can confirm the control was in place and operating effectively based on the results documented in the report.

          "body": "@emu-gov @troyfine @ryantpatrick \r\nThis actually brings up another point regarding additional frameworks, and perhaps a greater philosophical underlying issue.\r\n\r\nAt what point is a assessor's (FedRAMP 3PAO, SOC2 auditor, ISO auditor, HITRUST, etc) validation deemed sufficient?  I ask this, because historically in the pre-20x world, where packages had essentially three levels of review (or more), even the 3PAO validation was often questioned.  Obviously, it is the AO's or FedRAMP's prerogative to review and perform a deep dive into the package, but I think the thought is to have a lighter touch review than in the past, hence the much faster package reviews happening today.\r\n\r\nSo I think it's important to understand at what point an auditor's evaluation is deemed acceptable.  And yes, we have R311 and A2LA for FedRAMP 3PAOs, but I think determing the level of trust we are going to grant credence to the opinion of an auditor from another framework is a valuable exercise.  Just like we offer presumption of adequacy for an ATO to be reused, should we have some way to presume adequacy and trust for non-FedRAMP auditors?  This would prevent the re-evaluation of a SOC2 report by an A2LA accredited FedRAMP 3PAO.  Which is mostly rework, more money, and more time, and not necessarily an improvement in the overall security posture of the CSO.  \r\n\r\nOr is this a rabbithole where we start having AICPA authorized SOC 2 assessors being required to follow R311 (or a subset thereof?) or certain KSIs require less rigor (e.g. a SOC 2 auditor's opinion on training vs SOC 2 auditor's opinion on encryption)?\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "This is absolutely true.  There are some ways to address this, although not in a one-size-fits-all sense.\r\n\r\n1) One can define your controls against the COSO principles with 800-53.  (@troyfine and I did a mapping of this back in the rev 4 days), so that can be required.  If they do it right, it's usable; if not, it's not (or only partially usable).  I believe that there is an official SOC 2 to 800-53 mapping out there today as well.\r\n2) You don't have to use all or nothing of the SOC 2.  Only areas that directly align with a KSI or whatever may be deemed usable (as far as giving credit for)\r\n3) You can require standards for the SOC 2 auditors.   Not supplanting AICPA, but 'we will accept a SOC 2, if the SOC 2 auditor satisfies these requirements... ' (Think A2LA R311 type stuff).\r\n4) Not all controls/KSIs are equal.  From a risk appetite perspective, I'd be willing to trust a SOC 2 regarding training, but perhaps not on encryption.  I think there's opportunities to create a usable structure to determine what aspects of a SOC 2 are usable as-is, which are usable if they align with our needs, and some which may never be usable.  And then we make a hopefully low friction mechanism to account for the delta.\r\n\r\nThe more discussion I see, the more it seems like the consensus is that SOC 2 doesn't work.  I'd like to change that mindset and figure out ways where some/part of it CAN work.  It's not all or nothing,  and I think figuring out what 'credit' we are willing to grant to a SOC 2 sets some guidelines and foundation when we expand to other frameworks.  \r\n\r\n",
