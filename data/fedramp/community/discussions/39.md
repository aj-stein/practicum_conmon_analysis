Is there an "estimated" timeline for Mod and High?  You are making exceptional progress on Low for sure.  Congrats to all.

We're estimating starting 20xP2 shortly after 20xP1 ends, which is currently estimated for September. No estimate on High until we get a bit further in.

Would an annual Low assessment (ie authorized in previous years) be accepted into the pilot program?

The pilot is only for 20x based authorizations, not Rev5 based authorizations.

What happens to the 20x low authorizations once the 12 months is up?

Pilot participants will need to meet the formal post-pilot authorization requirements 20x (both initial and ongoing) to maintain authorizations past the initial 12mo period. For trailblazers this will likely include rework to adjust presentation, assessment, validation, evidence, reporting, etc. based on what we learn during the 20xP1 and 20xP2 pilots.

1. What do you think are the biggest problems still to be solved?
2. What particular parts of FR20x do you think will be most valuable?
3. Are we seeing alignment with agency and other federal stakeholders? If not, what concerns do they have with the process.

1. The biggest one on my mind at the moment is creating a real-time web of trust w/ cryptographic validation. In six months, a CSP will be leveraging validation capabilities from their IaaS/PaaS, integrated with their GRC automation tool, supplemented by maybe a couple additional third-party cybersecurity tools, and maybe leveraging three FedRAMP authorized external services. We need a way for the CSP to present their validated configuration and usage of all of those systems with proof they haven't tampered with any of it and that it's accurate against their inventory and information flows. ðŸ¤” 

2. Moving away from yearly point in time towards anything approaching actual continuous monitoring is the most valuable security outcome. Value can be measured in a lot of other ways too. ;)

3. Yes, in general. The federal stakeholder situation is still changing at an unprecedented rate. CIOs, CISOs, and senior security folks all across gov are changing over. That's why we're focused on CSPs and delivery right now.

The significant concern we've heard from extremely conservative agencies is that they do not ever intend to trust any business to make decisions without those decisions being approved by the agency. It's a line in the sand that we can't engage with, as FedRAMP has been explicitly directed to deliver an approach that allows commercial services to make changes without advance permission from the agency.

Are VMs allowed to be part of a system that is in the pilot program? There's plenty of verbiage about containers. Just want a little clarity

We don't have any explicit restrictions, just things that we think are more likely to take less effort.

For a system that is already Moderate-authorized - when should we expect to update our monthly and annual deliverables? Should we be working with our customers/educating them on changes coming with KSI, etc. now?

[This post in the Rev5 working group addresses how these changes will be balanced in Rev5 updates.](https://github.com/fedRAMP/community/discussions/38)

What's the status to your new FedRAMP documentation rollout for updated FedRAMP Rev 5 and 20x?

I'm not sure exactly what this is referring to, but you can see the current [20x Standards here](https://www.fedramp.gov/20x/standards/) and our [approach to balancing in Rev5 here](https://github.com/fedRAMP/community/discussions/38).

We're pushing more towards machine readable requirements and standards in the near future as well.
