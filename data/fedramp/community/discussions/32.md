# Post

**Paramify** has published a 20x Phase One Pilot Draft Submission available at: 
**https://github.com/paramify/fedramp-20x-pilot** 

**Summary of 20x Draft Submission**
Paramify's draft submission focuses on the method used to track and assess KSIs, generate a machine readable package, continuously monitor and report on implementation status and issues. As a draft, this submission does not constitute a complete, finalized package, but is intended to demonstrate our process and solicit feedback on improvements to meet the goals of FedRAMP 20x. The proposed YAML machine-readable schema is available for review and feedback. Paramify is working with Schellman as 3PAO. We look forward to the community's feedback!

I regret to inform you that government regulations prevent us from prioritizing submissions or immediately granting automatic FedRAMP authorizations on the basis of dank cats. ðŸ˜­ Someone on the team will crack into this shortly, and I'm excited to see what other folks say about it as well.

At a quick glance this sure is shiny.
