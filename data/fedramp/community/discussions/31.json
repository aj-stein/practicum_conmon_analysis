But validation that this training was provided to those supporting the FedRAMP environment can't be guaranteed, it's up to the SOC auditors and CSP to define the scope. And specific content requirements of the security awareness training program aren't spelled out by SOC2, so topics baked into the rev 5 FedRAMP baseline such as insider threat awareness would no longer be guaranteed.",

      "body": "FedRAMP also has role based training requirements.  SOC2 doesn't necessarily require training, but companies often use training to meet some of the COSO principles such as:  \r\n _The entity demonstrates a commitment to attract, develop, and retain, competent individuals in alignment with objectives_\r\nor\r\n_The entity holds individuals accountable for their internal control responsibilities in the pursuit of objectives._ \r\n\r\nIf a company's general security training covers insider threat and social engineering, it can be used for both assessments. \r\n",

      "body": "This boils to scoping of the environment and the assessment. It is likely today that if a CSP has separate commercial and federal environment that they aren't overlaying all the same controls. But they are likely meeting all the controls (and this case security training) within the federal environment - and training the requisite staff accordingly.\r\n\r\nI guess the question is - is the FR PMO going to accept testing results outright or are CSPs going to have to provide supporting evidence as a part of the package? If the latter, then I think it would be difficult to accept SOC 2 because it is simply a pdf report.",
