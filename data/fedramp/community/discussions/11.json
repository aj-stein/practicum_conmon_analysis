Can a pilot participant transition to a traditional Agency/800-53-based Moderate either during or at the end of phase one if a sponsor is identified that wants a traditional Agency Moderate?**\r\n\r\n**2. Does the PMO have any objection to a pilot participant simultaneously pursuing a traditional Agency/800-53-based Moderate in parallel to the pilot?**\r\n\r\nThe goal behind these questions is to understand the flexibility participants may have and the degree to which they are locked into to the pilot path once they are committed.\r\n\r\nThe answer to these questions will help CSPs better assess the benefits and risks associated with participation.",

I ask because one key part of FedRAMP Rev. 5 and FedRAMP 20x is keeping the Collaborative ConMon Meetings yet CA-7, the control this is mapped to in Rev. 5, isn't mentioned in the KSIs (potentially because this is an initial assessment opposed to ConMon, so there wouldn't be any meetings before authorization). Has FedRAMP PMO considered on what security controls/security indicators, which might require manual testing, that it intends to keep or do away with it? I ask because I think that would allow organizations to give better feedback on the KSIs since currently they might not say something due to them thinking it will be addressed later, or you might get the other reaction where you will get feedback on more things which you plan to cover later. Hopefully that wasn't too confusing to follow.",

Then you can tell me how I did.\r\n\r\n\u201care KSIs going to be the only way a system's risk posture is assessed?\u201d\r\n\r\nShort answer, yes. When we started discussions about the 20x project we initially divided the KSIs into \u201cpolicy\u201d and \u201ctechnical\u201d KSIs. But we found that many of the security objectives we initially categorized as \u201cpolicy\u201d could actually be programmatically assessed. Our strong preference is for automated assessments so we decided to start from a position of assuming all KSIs can be validated autonomously. Our current pilot is, in part, intended to validate or disprove that hypothesis and we would expect to update the KSIs based on that validation.  \r\n\r\n\u201cHas FedRAMP PMO considered on what security controls/security indicators, which might require manual testing, that it intends to keep or do away with it?\u201d\r\n\r\nOne of the main goals of the 20x program is to eliminate requirements/controls that do not provide valuable information for determining risk. Further, we want to identify the minimal set of KSIs needed to support risk based decision making by the Authorizing Officials at federal agencies. \r\n\r\nLastly, I would remind everyone that the KSIs are not intended to be just an abstraction layer on top of the 800-53 controls. We want the focus to be on \u201cDo the KSIs help us define and understand the risk of using a cloud service?\u201d and not specifically on which controls are addressed by each KSI.",

It's a good thing, yes? AND you also want to ensure that OTHER automation-specific controls are also available to CSPs, yes?  \r\n\r\nSo as a concrete example, say CP-1, CP-2, CP-3, CP-4:\r\n\r\nPre-20x: spend a lot of time showing you have a policy, a procedure, a plan and training. \r\n\r\nPost-20x: fine to have those, and even fine to report a boolean status that those exist and are approved - but - the higher priority is do the system metrics, eg uptime and # incidents, and MTTF, etc demonstrate that those are WORKING to improve the posture of the system?\r\n\r\nFair interpretation?",

          "body": "Thank you for the response. Perfectly understand the intent of moving away from strict control testing/thought process. Below for further clarification:\r\n1. Should a KSI be added to document holding Agency Collaborative ConMon Meetings? It seems this is a vital concept as PMO takes a step back and agencies will need to work together to find a standard for what necessitates a CAP yet is not addressed by the current KSIs. Would it make sense to give that feedback now or later?\r\n2. While it might seem strange to note now what concepts are definitely not going to be included in KSIs even in further iterations, since you might think the current lack of inclusion states that already, I think it might be helpful to point out the items which won't most likely be added that way people can give feedback on why they think those should be included. For example, a security concept which I think is outdated and won't be brought up is SC-7(18): Fail Secure. Whenever it came up during testing, it was always stated that this is a control based on old technology and that this is all already built into new systems. Whereas I think a KSI should address Agency Collaborative ConMon Meetings. It is hard currently to determine what will be added at higher baselines and if something should be brought up now or later.\r\nHope this added some more clarity on the intent of my aim and wasn't just completely off the mark based on what you said.\r\n",

Incomplete drafts are strongly encouraged.\r\n\r\n> 1. I presume it's ok from previous calls and discussions here to send a link to a public Github repo specific to this draft submission?\r\n\r\nYes! In fact, as stated on the pilot page: \"FedRAMP will prioritize public package submissions for the 20x pilot effort to facilitate the most efficient feedback mechanisms.\" In short, we can't provide personalized feedback to private submissions to avoid conflicts or advantages, but we _can_ provide personalized feedback to public submissions in public. \r\n\r\nAs stated in [CISA BOD 20-01](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-20-01-develop-and-publish-vulnerability-disclosure-policy), \"Cybersecurity is a public good that is strongest when the public is given the ability to contribute.\" [This post in the public submission thread has more details and background on why](https://github.com/FedRAMP/automating-assessment-cwg/discussions/38#discussioncomment-13196528) - note that we do expect providers to make risk determinations and obviously you should not publish something that will likely lead to compromise. \r\n\r\n> 2. Is the SOC2 a hard requirement for a draft submission?\r\n\r\nSOC2 is NOT a hard requirement - quoting the web page again, \"the FedRAMP 20x Phase One pilot is open to the public and there are no specific eligibility requirements to participate.\" \r\n\r\nThere is [additional background on why FedRAMP indicated providers with a SOC2 would be best positioned to qualify for authorization during Phase One here](https://github.com/FedRAMP/applying-existing-frameworks-cwg/discussions/31#discussioncomment-13053134) but it is not a requirement.\r\n\r\n> 3. We are talking to several 3PAOs. For the draft is simply attesting that we have these 3PAOs engaged and are engaged in discussions on how they would validate things, is that sufficient for Draft?\r\n\r\nYes. It's okay if drafts are incomplete or works in progress - you don't even necessarily need to have talked to a 3PAO at all, though we'd recommend the draft share how you plan to indicate and track a 3PAO's ultimate involvement. There is no 3PAO requirements for working on drafts.\r\n\r\n> 4. We plan to share all KSI assessment info completely open source - however - neither in the draft, nor in the final submission - did we want to publicly release the actual evidence data.  ...\r\n\r\nThat's fine. It would be helpful for folks to know why you made that decision and how you will make that information available as needed to auditors, how it will be maintained separately, etc. For the final submission, FedRAMP will need to have access to that evidence (as will agency reviewers) for authorization but cloud service providers retain control of their own intellectual property and are empowered to make decisions about who they share it with and how.\r\n",

          "body": "@cooper-vanta \r\nInteresting.  Kudos for both being the first, and doing something thorough.  It's great to see an organization that put a lot of thought into this.  I have some follow up questions/thoughts (for both Vanta and FedRAMP).\r\n\r\n1) If the intent was to provide status of the KSIs (and validated by a 3PAO), I think this is spot on.  However, and this may be a big misunderstanding on my part, I always thought that the purpose was to have the output from various commands showing the actual technical validation of certain controls rather than just a status, and that's what always made me concerned about the viability of such a mechanism.    For example, the results of some sort of query against a given control.  Using the training KSI, showing the command pulling data from an LMS system showing that the 'role based training module' had 100 participation, or something like that.  So one or two levels deeper than this.  Not a criticism, by the way, more a calibration with the actual goal.  I might have been overthinking this.\r\n\r\n2) If this is what FedRAMP is looking for, it seems that this is essentially a replacement of the old SRTM/Test Case Workbook.  Rather than a 1400 item spreadsheet of doom, it seems sufficient for the 3PAO (and again, kudos to Schellman for their work here) to validate things and give them a pass/fail that is included in a JSON.  @FedRAMP people, is that the goal?  If so, big thumbs up from me.  That saves a ton of repetitive paperwork.  \r\n\r\n3) I see this as a high level status, but if an agency or customer wanted to drill down, and say 'ok, show me the encryption stuff', what and how would that look like?  Would that also be a machine readable thing, or that's where we revert back to SRTM, evidence, screenshots and the like.\r\n\r\n4) I like the fact that a 3PAO approved/reviewed this and how they did so.  One of my initial concerns was 'oh look, here's a status dashboard and surprise surprise, everything is green.'  The way Vanta and Schellman did this alleviated that concern.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",

Appreciate your patience with the rigamarole.\r\n\r\n> For CSPs and 3PAOs currently participating in 20x pilot assessments, we would welcome FedRAMP's thoughts on how KSIs are to be applied in practice during the pilot phase\u2014particularly in areas where statutory or policy-driven obligations (e.g., FIPS-validated encryption or incident reporting timeframes) are not explicitly referenced in the KSI language.\r\n\r\nFair point - the KSIs generally avoid explicitly referencing things that may change outside of FedRAMP activities. These details will need to be supported with technical assistance and best practices before the 20x assessment process is formalized as a complete process.\r\n\r\nRegarding the Phase One pilot specifically:\r\n\r\n> 1. Should assessors and CSPs assume that these federally mandated requirements remain in scope even if they are not included in the KSIs?\r\n\r\nYes, though assessors and CSPs should apply reasonable frameworks related to this (e.g. FIPS-validated encryption may not be necessary in services that do not handle federal information and many policy related controls can be compensated for). Questions about specific scenarios can also be addressed publicly, but generally Low impact has a bit of leeway.\r\n\r\nWe would recommend that assessors err towards documenting potential issues and moving the package forward for FedRAMP's review during the pilot so we can weigh in directly when needed. We understand that the amount of ambiguity here means an assessor might not be comfortable making a recommendation without additional direct guidance.\r\n\r\n> 2. Will FedRAMP provide supplemental guidance during the pilot that explicitly maps relevant mandates to the appropriate KSIs or support materials?\r\n\r\nNo, supplemental guidance for this specific use case will not be available during Phase One and will be minimal during Phase Two. Determining the need for and appropriate coverage required for this type of supplemental guidance is part of the purpose of the pilot. \r\n\r\n",

          "body": "Whew, okay, this has a ton of questions that I'm not going to be able to get to directly. In general, I'm going to re-frame and emphasize two key points outlined on the [20x Phase One pilot page](https://www.fedramp.gov/20x/phase-one/):\r\n\r\n1. The purpose of the pilot is to assess the feasibility of this general approach. This includes understanding where there are gaps, where additional questions need to be answered, and what it might take to answer them. That is why this is a Phase One pilot, not a formal authorization path.\r\n\r\n2. The approach is intended to be designed in collaboration with industry stakeholders and agency experts. FedRAMP expects industry stakeholders to have, present, test, and demonstrate strong opinions that will help us assess the feasibility of this approach. \r\n\r\nFedRAMP is explicitly limiting the amount of prescriptive direction in alignment with our core direction from leadership to enable private innovation to provide solutions.\r\n\r\nAs such, I'm really curious to hear what industry stakeholders and agency experts have to say on some of these topics. I'll pick out a few to weigh in on myself:\r\n\r\n> does the 3PAO only validate the KSIs and NOT the NIST controls?\r\n\r\nA good starting point here may be to review [SP 800-53A Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Information Systems and Organizations](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/a/r5/final) Chapter 3.5 on \"Assess Security and Privacy Capabilities\" and consider that application to the goals of this pilot.\r\n\r\nThe 20x package should be assessed and judged based on how effectively it meets the capabilities represented by the KSIs. If there is a specific failure, the root-cause NIST control may be determined and flagged if this is helpful. However, ultimately, the authorization decision (and thus the assessor's recommendation) should be made based on the capabilities represented by the KSIs.\r\n\r\nRegarding the other questions in this context, during the pilot we anticipate innovative solutions for how 3PAOs and CSPs cooperate on validation.\r\n\r\n>  \u201cTo qualify\u2026provide a machine readable package\u2026for a significant portion of the FedRAMP Key Security Indicators (KSIs)\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\nThere's additional information about expectations on the [20x Phase One pilot page](https://www.fedramp.gov/20x/phase-one/) and in the Q&A here. \r\n\r\n> New requirements/controls in RFC 0006 for Low baseline (e.g., AC-23, AT-6). Was that the intention?\r\n\r\nYes. The KSIs reflect the capabilities FedRAMP expects cloud service offerings to meet for a 20x Low authorization. It is not a direct rip and replace of previous baselines.\r\n\r\n> Is this \u201cconditional authorization\u201d a new type of ATO FedRAMP is rolling out?  What happens to currently Low authorized CSPs? Should they forgo their Low assessment and do the KSI model? OR  Should they continue with their Con Mon?\r\n\r\nFedRAMP does not have authority to do ATOs; FedRAMP authorizations are certifications that a cloud service completed a FedRAMP authorization process. It's a dictionary definition use of the word authorization and is not an ATO. \r\n\r\nThe 20x approach will result in Program Authorizations (as outlined in M-24-15) for qualifying participants. This pilot and the KSIs are entirely unrelated to the Rev 5 Agency Authorization path for FedRAMP authorization and such offerings are not affected by it in any way (though they may be affected by parallel modernization initiatives).\r\n\r\n> Does the FedRAMP Subnetting Whitepaper still apply as guiding principle?\r\n\r\nThis is a great specific question - for 20x pilot participants following the KSI approach, the Subnetting Whitepaper is somewhat explicitly overridden by the CNA KSIs. The Subnetting Whitepaper should not be applied. We'll make a note to include this in technical assistance.\r\n\r\n> New KSI states that vulnerability scans now target publicly accessible components.\r\n> SBOM principles\r\n> No ZTA applied to IA\r\n\r\nSome things will definitely changed based on public comment; all of these are likely candidates.\r\n\r\n> KSI and Modernization - Who is responsible for curating the standards and adapting to ecosystem changes?\r\n\r\nFedRAMP will maintain the standards.\r\n\r\n> KSIs and Shared Service Model\r\n\r\nWe tried to structure Phase One KSIs in a way that somewhat ignored requires that would typically be managed within the shared service model and replaced it with a global requirement that the cloud service offering use only FedRAMP authorized services.\r\n\r\nThis will be much more complicated to address when we move past SaaS that only use FedRAMP authorized IaaS/PaaS. Fantastic points on suppliers of secure images; another complicated thing to address separately, if possible.\r\n\r\n> KSI-CNA, Part 2: Configure firewalls/proxy servers to limit inbound and outbound traffic. o Is there a priority to focus on internal traffic, external to internal traffic, or both?\r\n\r\nGenerally these are equally important; preventing information from being exfiltrated during a compromise is an effective mitigation and compensating control that lowers overall risk.\r\n\r\n> \u2022 For KSI-MLA, Part 2: Regularly review and audit logs. o What is the time frame meant by \u201cregular\u201d?\r\n\r\nAt the moment this is a plain language word; CSPs should define the intervals/pattern they use backed by an appropriate risk based justification.\r\n\r\n> \u2022 KSI-SC, Part 1: Harden and review network and system configurations. o Is there a specific standard required to be used (CIS, STIG, etc.)?\r\n\r\nLooking forward to seeing how folks innovate here.\r\n\r\n> Numerous KSI\u2019s \u2013 Encryption (FIPS 140) o Do the encryption requirements (FIPS not noted) need to be FIPS 140-2 and/or FIPS 140-3 (and no historical)?\r\n\r\nFedRAMP's [policy for cryptographic module selection and use applies](https://www.fedramp.gov/rev5/fips/) to all FedRAMP authorizations at the moment, even though it's in the Rev 5 section; it's very important that the section on \"cases where a validated module is not necessary\" be applied. This allows for much more flexibility.\r\n\r\nFedRAMP may separately ease these requirements for Low.\r\n\r\nWhew, okay, think that got through most of it. Thanks for all the time and thought put into those questions!\r\n",
