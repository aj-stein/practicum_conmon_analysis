  "body": "# RFC-0005 Minimum Assessment Scope Standard\r\n\r\n> - Status: Closed\r\n> - Created By: FedRAMP PMO\r\n> - Start Date: 2025-04-24\r\n> - Closing Date: 2025-05-25\r\n> - Short Name: rfc-0005-minimum-assessment-scope\r\n\r\n## Where to Comment\r\n\r\nMon May 26 09:51:01 EDT 2025\r\n\r\nThis RFC is now closed to public comment. Many thanks to all the participants!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThe FedRAMP Minimum Assessment Scope proposes an approach to assessing the security of federal information handled by cloud services that provide services to federal agency customers by including all information resources managed by a cloud service provider and their cloud service offering that:\r\n\r\n1. Handle federal information; and/or\r\n2. Likely impact confidentiality, integrity, or availability of federal\r\n   information\r\n\r\nInformation resources where (1) or (2) do not apply, including most metadata, should be excluded from FedRAMP assessment.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Rationale\r\n\r\nThis draft standard updates January\u2019s RFC-0004 Boundary Policy draft based on public feedback and changes to the operating environment for FedRAMP. Due to executive branch restrictions on the production of significant guidance and policy materials, this draft proposes a simplified approach to the assessment of information resources that should be included in a FedRAMP assessment and authorization.\r\n\r\nThe FedRAMP Minimum Assessment Scope will replace the former FedRAMP Boundary approach with a simple and reasonable test that can be applied by cloud service providers, third-party assessment organizations, and agency officials. The Minimum Assessment Scope avoids unnecessary detail or specifics to support FedRAMP\u2019s ongoing shift from compliance-based decision making and assessment to security-based decision making and assessment.\r\n\r\n## Explanation\r\n\r\nThe full draft standard is approximately 2 pages and is available for review as follows:\r\n\r\n- [Basic web formatting on fedramp.gov](https://fedramp.gov/updates/rfcs/0005)\r\n- Basic text markdown on GitHub (below)\r\n- PDF file:  [rfc-0005-minimum-assessment-scope.pdf](https://github.com/FedRAMP/rfcs/raw/main/rfc/assets/0005-minimum-assessment-scope.pdf)\r\n- DOCX file:  [rfc-0005-minimum-assessment-scope.docx](https://github.com/FedRAMP/rfcs/raw/main/rfc/assets/0005-minimum-assessment-scope.docx)\r\n\r\n## Discussion Requested\r\n\r\nThis draft standard is open for any public comment. FedRAMP encourages fast, informal comments from any member of the public. The public may submit multiple comments and may respond to other public comments. All comments from the public sent via email will be made public.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# RFC-0005 Minimum Assessment Scope Standard\r\n\r\nThursday, April 24, 2025\r\n\r\n_Note: The Minimum Assessment Scope was formerly referred to as the FedRAMP Boundary Policy / Boundary Guidance_\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n> [OMB Circular A-130: Managing Information as a Strategic Resource](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/OMB/circulars/a130/a130revised.pdf) section 10 states that an \u201cAuthorization boundary\u201d includes _\u201call components of an information system to be authorized for operation by an authorizing official. This excludes separately authorized systems to which the information system is connected.\u201d_ and further adds in footnote 64 that _\u201cAgencies have significant flexibility in determining what constitutes an information system and its associated boundary.\u201d_\r\n\r\n> [NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2: Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/37/r2/final) chapter 2.4 footnote 36 similarly states that _\u201cthe term authorization boundary is now used exclusively to refer to the set of system elements comprising the system to be authorized for operation or authorized for use by an authorizing official (i.e., the scope of the authorization).\u201d_\r\n\r\n> [The FedRAMP Authorization Act (44 USC \u00a7 3607 (b) (7))](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2023-title44/USCODE-2023-title44-chap36-sec3607) defines \u201cFedRAMP authorization\u201d as _\u201ca certification that a cloud computing product or service has \u2026 completed a FedRAMP authorization process, as determined by the Administrator \\[of the General Services Administration\\]\u201d_ This responsibility is [delegated to the FedRAMP Director](https://www.gsa.gov/directives-library/gsa-delegations-of-authority-fedramp).\r\n\r\n# Introduction\r\n\r\nThis standard moves FedRAMP away from reusing terminology and definitions designed for traditional information systems that often included a physical or logical \u201cboundary\u201d to contain information flow. FedRAMP is establishing a cloud-native approach to security assessment and authorization of cloud service offerings and their application and use within federal agency authorization boundaries.\r\n\r\nFedRAMP authorization is certification that a cloud service has completed a FedRAMP assessment process to collect essential security information that shall be presumed adequate for use by federal agency authorizing officials making formal authorization decisions. FedRAMP authorization is not authorization to operate because agency authorizing officials are entirely responsible for reviewing and authorizing the operation of cloud services based on their own use case and environment.\r\n\r\nFedRAMP asserts that tying FedRAMP authorizations to an \u201cauthorization boundary\u201d creates confusion because the boundary specified in an agency\u2019s authorization to operate a cloud service will always include additional resources related to the agency\u2019s environment of operations. Agencies must follow OMB and NIST guidance to establish an appropriate authorization boundary for agency information systems that use FedRAMP authorized or certified cloud services.\r\n\r\nThis updated standard creates a standardized FedRAMP Minimum Assessment Scope that rescinds and replaces ALL previous guidance related to the boundaries of all FedRAMP authorizations and certifications, including the current Rev 5 Agency Authorization process and FedRAMP 20x. Best practices and technical assistance for following the FedRAMP Minimum Assessment Scope will be published separately.\r\n\r\n# Definitions\r\n\r\nThe following definitions apply to all FedRAMP materials:\r\n\r\na. \u201c**Federal information**\u201d has the meaning as defined in [OMB Circular A-130](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/OMB/circulars/a130/a130revised.pdf) and any successor documents. As of Apr 2025, this means _\u201cinformation created, collected, processed, maintained, disseminated, disclosed, or disposed of by or for the federal government, in any medium or form.\u201d_\r\n\r\nb. \u201c**Information resources**\u201d is defined in [44 USC \u00a7 3502 (6)](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2023-title44/USCODE-2023-title44-chap35-subchapI-sec3502) as _\u201cinformation and related resources, such as personnel, equipment, funds, and information technology.\u201d_ This applies to any aspect of the cloud service offering, both technical and managerial, including everything that makes up the business of the offering from organizational policies and procedures to hardware, software, and code.\r\n\r\n# FedRAMP Minimum Assessment Scope\r\n\r\nThe FedRAMP Minimum Assessment Scope establishes the fundamental requirements for all aspects of a cloud service provider and cloud service offering that MUST be included within the boundary of a FedRAMP assessment and authorization package.\r\n\r\nThe Minimum Assessment Scope includes all information resources managed by a cloud service provider and their cloud service offering that:\r\n\r\n1. Handle federal information; and/or\r\n2. Likely impact confidentiality, integrity, or availability of federal information\r\n\r\n# Application of Minimum Assessment Scope\r\n\r\nThe following statements provide additional clarification on applying the Minimum Assessment Scope for FedRAMP:\r\n\r\nA. Information resources and metadata that do not meet condition (1) or (2) are outside the Minimum Assessment Scope.\r\n\r\nB. If the cloud service uses information resources from other FedRAMP authorized or certified services then only the configuration and usage of those information resources is included in the Minimum Assessment Scope.\r\n\r\nC. If the cloud service uses information resources from other services that are not FedRAMP authorized or certified then all aspects of those services where (1) or (2) applies are included in the Minimum Assessment Scope.\r\n\r\nD. Software and other such products (including agents and clients) that are installed, managed, and operated on agency information systems are outside the scope of FedRAMP. Any information resources in the cloud service that control or communicate with such products are within the Minimum Assessment Scope if (1) or (2) applies.\r\n\r\nE. Information resources of the service offering may vary by impact level as appropriate to the level of information handled or impacted by the information resource so long as this is clearly identified and documented.\r\n\r\nF. Stakeholders should review best practices and technical assistance provided separately by FedRAMP for help with applying the Minimum Assessment Scope as needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I think a draft version of boundary guidance tried (and failed) to provide clarity and it was never finalized, possibly for that reason.  The absence of a hard definition here causes all kinds of confusion, because CSPs think in good faith, absent clear explanations, that things like IP addresses of systems that host federal data are neither federal metadata, nor sensitive.  In my former 3PAO life, this came up frequently, controversially, and never really had a great bright line definition for stakeholders to apply.\r\n\r\nIn theory, I like these changes.  In practice, all I request is that it is easy and obvious to determine whether something is in scope or out of scope.  I'd also humbly request some examples.  This is something FedRAMP historically did not want to do because it gave the impression of favoring certain implementations, but I think this can be genericized enough to avoid that.  e.g. vulnerability data, or IP address, etc.",

      "body": "This is fairly long, but bear with me, it unpacks a lot of frustration from years of dealing with boundary disputes.\r\n\r\nI echo the sentiment shared by previous commenters. While I understand FedRAMP attempting to promote a more flexible program that does not stand between industry and its customers, I do not believe more readily defined standards do that. CSPs have long struggled with competing interpretations of boundary guidance that have wreaked havoc on decision making. Disagreements between CSPs, 3PAOs, Agencies, and the JAB / PMO resulted in many more delays and excessive spend than better definitions have, even if the decisions create technical limitations.\r\n\r\nBefore the draft 2.0 and 3.0 guidance it was not uncommon for CSP GRC, security teams and engineering to debate ad nauseam over what \u201cfederal data and metadata\u201d meant or what would likely have security impact to the boundary or federal data within. Then we would make a decision only to have a 3PAO or agency tell us we were wrong and have to rearchitect accordingly, usually on a short turnaround with much pain and cost. Sometimes all were in agreement only to switch 3PAOs (or they provided a different team) and those assessors have a different opinion and interpretation of the definitions, and ultimately arbitration was needed from an Agency, and those interpretations varied Agency by Agency. This often ground the work to a halt while waiting for resolution, especially with less active agencies.\r\n\r\nThe draft 2.0 and 3.0 guidance provided better definitions and boundary handling instructions especially over what types of information may constitute direct vs indirect impact metadata. This significantly reduced the disagreements between CSPs internally, and between CSPs and 3PAOs and ultimately required less arbitration from Agencies who were often reluctant to step in anyway (besides the fact that technical understanding and nuance aren\u2019t always abundant in these conversations).\r\n\r\nOn the point of paralyzed decision making others have discussed (here and on other platforms), ambiguity in these standards has historically created more analysis paralysis than it\u2019s prevented. At least from my own perspective supporting multiple CSPs achieve FedRAMP objectives for the past 7 years, the business vs. security battle does not benefit from \u201cflexibility via ambiguity.\u201d Many of us here know the uphill battle both security and compliance face in business decision making and having even remotely better definitions helps us head-off some of those battles and concretely demonstrate risk (even if it is merely risk of non-compliance or contracting risk). Beyond that many of us who have dealt with 3PAOs know they don\u2019t always like to commit to an answer on in/out of boundary (and I don\u2019t really blame them, a) it puts them at risk, and b) it\u2019s not really their place to influence CSP decisions outside their assessor role). \r\n\r\nI understand the FedRAMP PMO\u2019s view of what this program should look like moving forward and to not stifle innovation, but honestly innovation should be slow when it comes to safeguarding potentially highly sensitive Federal data sets. Balancing compliance and security is an admirable goal (we all want security theatre ultimately eliminated), but much of these programs are where they are today because of industry failing to meet their obligations to safeguard and protect federal information, and we have plenty of examples to look back on. My fear is moving back to open ended definitions requiring industry to effectively interpret meaning in boundary development, as essentially the \u201cconsumer\u201d of these standards, and 3PAOs and Agencies to consistently, effectively and efficiently communicate their interpretations, moves us away from a \u201cstandardized\u201d program that promotes reuse and informs broad consensus across participants, to one that looks a lot more individualized. The definitions will differ based on who your 3PAO is or who your primary Agency sponsor is and what their individual interpretations look like, which is admittedly how things looked early on in the program. That may have fostered a lower time-to-market for CSPs and eliminated barriers for customers to procure what they needed, but it was absolutely miserable on the CSP trying to hit moving targets of interpretation, to the point where many of the early authorized CSPs are still recovering from bad architecture decisions that ambiguity led to. \r\n\r\nI think industry would much prefer better definitions with a mechanism for broad consensus (the comments periods for the FedRAMP policies and standards here on Github, or a more defined governance process akin to IEEE), which I think fits in perfectly with the industry led future of FedRAMP 20X and WGs. Rather than a return to ambiguity and siloed conversations on interpretation between individual CSPs and their 3PAOs and agencies that may never inform a larger audience.",

          "body": "@andrew-hive \r\nWell said.  Just to add some color to the 3PAOs role:  We were held responsible for vetting the boundary diagrams (and got our hands slapped if it wasn't 'good enough') prior to submission.  HOWEVER, we also could not 'fix the diagram' because that would violate our independence as assessors.  My usual approach, during a project kickoff was to joke that 'expect to go back and forth on the diagram about 7 times' to set the expectation, and explain why.  But yeah, that was a thing, and it caused all manner of frustration.\r\n\r\nFurther, auth boundary diagram (ABD) and actual boundary/scope are not the same thing.  Even if the scope was well defined, if the ABD didn't show all of the details, that would be the sticking point.  \r\n\r\nBy the way, no shade is being thrown on the reviewers; they were operating under fairly strict rules from their side.  As complicated as it sometimes got, the discussions tended to be good, collegial, and collaborative.  My approach was to try and get ahead of expectations to minimize the required tweaks.  I also had a checklist I used to vet ABDs, and due to some of the subjectivity, it was designed to ensure all mandatory elements existed, but otherwise try and get most of the other stuff so that any issues were minimal.  It usually worked out reasonably well.",

          "body": "@andrew-hive I sympathize a lot with this. However, I ultimately think the new direction is still better overall. There will be more discussions and disagreements at points in the process, but I believe there will be less pain overall. System cost and function will work better over the life of the offering if it is architected right instead of architected to arbitrarily meet a overly-prescriptive list with a short lifespan.\r\n\r\nI believe that the change in FedRAMPs philosophy will solve most of this problem. As @jsantore-cgc mentioned, FedRAMP was heavy-handed in the past to get 3PAOs to conform to their vision rather than validate security controls. They did the same to their contractor reviewers trying to define how the system should operate instead of confirming that the FedRAMP process was followed.\r\n\r\n> I think industry would much prefer better definitions with a mechanism for broad consensus\r\n\r\nI think engineers from established CSPs would appreciate this, but from a TCO point of view, I think it will result in stifled innovation and I'm sure it will increase the cost over the life of the system, which means agencies and CSPs pay a premium. I also think innovative engineers from smaller players (aspiring CSPs) working to create new models would prefer the flexibility to propose new architectures unhindered by large players' opinions.",

The `CSP` is responsible for delivering their outline, Information data types, data flow diagrams, and clear boundaries / assessment scope elements (whatever the agency deems as a requirement, but FedRAMP must define the minimum requirements for gate).  (A good recommendation would be  a listing of all information data types and details on where and how they are used/stored/processed (could be data flow diagrams), CSO description/mission).\r\n2.  The `Agency AO`, `FedRAMP PMO` review the proposed solution, and the **rough** outline of the solution and come to a consensus of agreement or disagreement of boundary and assessment scope during the gate review.  Using the RMF process, place a gate review between Categorize and Select.  This gate review can happen more than once, if needed, but will help clearly define the scope with a bit of subjectivity based on CSO, and then the CSP knows exactly what additional mitigating controls they should incorporate on-top of the baseline, and can implement the solutions to meet requirements.\r\n3. The 3PAO assesses against the scope that was defined and agreed upon between the `CSP`, `Agency AO`, and `FedRAMP PMO`.  \r\n4. The `Agency AO` and `FedRAMP PMO` then review the package compared to the data presented in the gate review and confirm that the system did not deviate from the initial planned implementation (without additional communication or whatever the requirement is) and the assessment did not deviate from prescribed scope (no scope creep, or scope creep in line with boundary deviations).  \r\n\r\nThis would also support the Significant Change process, where if significant, these new features/services become part of the boundary/scope.  \r\n\r\nTo build on that, I think FedRAMP should retain minutes, decision records, etc, with the details of `categorize` and `prepare` of the CSO's in programmatic format, and assess themselves and the Agency AO to determine if their decision was in line with previous decisions, do a retrospective, and come out with better standards after each one, that will eventually support the automated selection of components in boundary and in scope for assessment, based on historical decisions.  That information can and should be passed on to the CSPs as developed, so that the gate reviews become a semi-automated streamline process.  \r\n\r\nCSPs and 3PAOs could also be held accountable for their deviations, if they dont implement what they planned, or communicate changes (following the proposed Change management process even before ATO).  \r\n",

Please clarify:\r\n\r\n- Whether such control planes are considered \u201cinformation resources\u201d even if they do not process federal data directly\r\n- Whether access to these management systems must be included in 3PAO testing (e.g., RBAC policies, logging configurations)\r\n\r\nThese platforms often have substantial impact on security posture and should be addressed clearly in the standard or companion guidance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### \u2705 Clarify Relationship Between SCN Process and Minimum Scope Standard\r\n\r\nWith RFC-0007 (Significant Change Notification) and RFC-0005 both in active consultation, it would help to clarify:\r\n\r\n- Whether changes to the Minimum Assessment Scope (e.g., new subsystems or decommissioning services) require submission under the SCN process\r\n- Whether adaptive changes that expand assessment scope require a new 3PAO review or can be deferred to annual assessments\r\n\r\nA short cross-reference or diagram in the final version would help CSPs integrate both processes smoothly.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### \u2705 Address Scope Application to CSP Personnel and Organizational Units\r\n\r\nThe phrase \u201cinformation resources\u201d is defined broadly to include \u201cpersonnel,\u201d yet no guidance is provided on which personnel fall in-scope for assessment. Recommend clarifying:\r\n\r\n- Whether only personnel with access to federal data (e.g., customer support, platform engineers) are included\r\n- Whether organizational units wholly unrelated to the CSO (e.g., internal HR, unrelated business lines) must be documented in scope boundaries\r\n\r\nThis ensures consistent interpretation and avoids excessive HR system review during assessments.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### \u2705 Recommend a \"Minimum Scope Checklist\" or Assessment Planning Template\r\n\r\nCSPs and 3PAOs would benefit from a standardized planning artifact to evaluate and document the application of the Minimum Assessment Scope. Recommend FedRAMP provide:\r\n\r\n- A \u201cMinimum Scope Checklist\u201d tied to criteria (1) and (2)\r\n- Optional supporting tools such as a visual boundary scoping map or tagging template\r\n\r\nThese would promote consistency, reduce dispute cycles, and help streamline onboarding of newer CSPs and 3PAOs.",

      "body": "Thank you for putting so much time and thought into the assessment scope and boundary. With interconnected systems, ZTA, and complexity, the old idea of boundary, while still holding validity, is somewhat antiquated in how it was traditionally applied.\r\n### My recommendations\r\n-\tOverall, I would like to encourage a massive culture shift, one that FedRAMP seems to embrace but that the CSPs are surprisingly latent to adopt. This is the shift that CSPs need to lead out on boldly creating and justifying cloud security models, and 3PAOS and agencies should take a backseat; the 3pao being more of a secondary opinion, the agency being the final approver. This seems to be a missing piece in the boundary dilemma discussion.\r\n-\tFor example, I have experienced some inter-3PAO disagreement. In these situations, I make my best argument for the why and what, and look at what might be mitigating. At times I make this argument to the lead agency as well.\r\n-\tFrom what I can surmise, FedRAMP is also separating the standard from examples, guidelines and recommendations. I believe having a less formal document with expectations and examples will answer the majority of questions that users have concerning this standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n### My philosophical thoughts \u2013 skip if you just wanted recommendations\r\n----------------\r\nScope may be the hardest part of FedRAMP. Certainly my first time through the process (before boundary 1.0), we spent months figuring it out. Then changed it. Then changed it again.\r\nThe direction of this guidance is fantastic: Does it impact the data, or can it impact the Data. Fantastic questions.\r\nThe interpretation and the evolution of the standard is of course where the difficulty really sets in.\r\nEngineers want prescriptive answers. But the answer is a moving target that needs to be weighed by multiple groups. \r\nFedRAMP traditionally wanted to draw a clear line around everything. But once again, this ignores the complexity of the environment,  and institutes a policy which FedRAMP was supposed to combat (the favoring of legacy architectures and actively discouraging new architectures).\r\nAs such, the long-term framework and rules need to be non-prescriptive but instead describe the desired outcome. \r\nThe problem with this is the million questions, exceptions, opinions, and discussions about how much a subsystem impacts the overall risk of an offering. \r\nWhat may be helpful is a list of trailing examples in a separate document:  \u201cx architecture is what we expect, if you disagree for your system, that is a signal for you to justify what you are doing and why. \u201cY\u201d architectures have been risk accepted in the past for stated reasons, if your reason is one of those , you will have some good understanding when you propose your difference.\u201d\r\nFedRAMP could also encourage ongoing discussion of security models in a long-term forum so that the target can move with the industry.\r\nOne big problem is that agencies and 3PAOS have led this conversation. CSPs should lead the conversation instead. While agencies make the final authorization decision, CSPs should lead out in describing why their implementation is the best choice and rigorously defend instead of fishing for a standard from these groups.\r\n",

      "body": "Overall, I like this uncomplicated Minimum Assessment Scope approach.  I just have a few comments / questions:\r\n\r\n### 1. Clarify the Treatment of Metadata\r\nThe current draft excludes \"most metadata\" from the assessment scope. However, metadata can sometimes contain sensitive information or influence system behavior. To prevent ambiguity, the standard should:\r\n\r\n- Define what constitutes \"metadata\" in this context.\r\n- Provide criteria (or examples) to determine when metadata should be included in the assessment scope, especially if it impacts the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of federal information.\r\n\r\n### 2. Provide More Guidance on Third-Party Services\r\nThe draft distinguishes between FedRAMP-authorized and non-authorized third-party services but needs clarification to ensure consistent application:\r\n\r\n- Offer clear criteria for assessing third-party services, including examples of scenarios that would necessitate their inclusion in the assessment scope.\r\n- Clarify responsibilities for documenting and assessing these services, especially when they are integral to the cloud service offering.\r\n\r\n### 3. Address Hybrid Deployment Scenarios\r\nWhile the draft mentions that software installed on agency systems is outside FedRAMP's scope, it doesn't address hybrid environments where cloud and on-premises systems / components interact. To clarity:\r\n\r\n- Provide guidance on assessing components in hybrid deployments, particularly when on-premises systems interact with cloud services in ways that could affect federal information.\r\n- Clarify the extent to which such interactions should be documented and assessed within the FedRAMP framework.\r\n\r\n### 4. Include Impact-Level Examples\r\nThe draft allows for varying assessment scopes based on impact levels but could use some examples. To help stakeholders:\r\n\r\n- Provide examples demonstrating how the assessment scope might differ between low, moderate, and high-impact systems.\r\n\r\n### 5. Provide Technical Assistance Materials\r\nThe draft mentions forthcoming best practices and technical assistance. This is great and we look forward to these materials. It would be very helpful if they included checklists and/or decision trees to assist in applying the Minimum Assessment Scope Standard effectively.",

Any information resources in the cloud service that control or communicate with such products are within the Minimum Assessment Scope if (1) or (2) applies.\r\n\r\nI would disagree or at least I think that FedRAMP should have a path to have agents/clients reviewed at as part of the assessment/accreditation. The idea of FedRAMP is do once use many. A large number of CSPs have some type of agent/clients with their offering. Having the Agent being \u201cin scope\u201d today and having it part of the Pen Test has allowed the much quicker deployment of this to a customer environment. Before we had FedRAMP this was a much larger pain, now we can point to an agent/client being in scope of testing and pen tested. Before each agency had a different process to go through to get agents/clients tested and approved, which was a mess.\r\n\r\nNote: If we do remove agents all together from the FedRAMP scope then the Pen Test guidance must be updated in parallel as that is currently attack vector 6\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

It is grey what a CSO should consider its own authorization boundary, which is separate from what agencies do. For example, what part of the the cloud service MUST be under FedRAMP assessment?\r\n\r\nDefinition - Agencies tend to extend the definition of federal information to the CSP's infrastructure, which should not be considered federal information. Federal information can be broadly interpreted and there should be additional guidance on this.\r\n\r\nApplication of Minimum Assessment Scope - Letter A, how is what is outside of scope agreed on and represented? For example, if federal information is scope appropriately, that means other supporting information resources are not considered in scope because they do not meet condition 1 and 2.\r\nLetter B - \"then only the configuration and usage of those information resources is included in the Minimum Assessment Scope\" is confusing as the cloud service can use their own hosted resources and then other resources from AWS for example. The way it is written reads as if the cloud services only use information resources from other FedRAMP authorized or certified services.\r\nLetter C - Reads as if it is permissible to use other services that are not FedRAMP authorized but \"all aspects of those services if (1) or (2) applies would be in scope. What is the difference between \"only the configuration and usage of those information resources is included in the Minimum Assessment Scope.\" vs \"all aspects of those services where (1) or (2) applies are included in the Minimum Assessment Scope.\"?\r\nSecond Part of Letter D is too vague - Any information resources in the cloud service that control or communicate with such products are within the Minimum Assessment Scope if (1) or (2) applies. So for example, if a CSP has a client that is optional and can be installed by the customer, then the services in scope communicating with that client are in scope.\r\nWhat is the meaning of Letter E - I think this means that a CSO that was was High can leverage non-FedRAMP authorized external services or FR authorized external services of varying impact levels as appropriate to the level of information handled or impacted by the information resource. Who makes this decision and how would FedRAMP like this documented?\r\n\r\n",

Will there be training CSPs and 3PAOs can take around this? It was helpful when the PMO previously published them. Additionally, it would be amazing if the PMO posted a test/dummy minimum assessment scope for a fake CSP so we can compare to what it should look like. \r\n",

      "body": "While the intent behind establishing a \u201cMinimum Assessment Scope\u201d is understandable, especially in light of efforts to streamline authorization processes and reduce redundant testing, the current draft lacks the specificity required to be actionable. If released in its current form, I believe this RFC may ultimately be detrimental to the goals of FedRAMP and the integrity of the assessment process.\r\n\r\nThis language leaves too much room for interpretation, which may lead to inconsistent scoping decisions between 3PAOs, CSPs, and reviewers. It implicitly shifts risk interpretation to individual assessors rather than grounding scope decisions in explicit and repeatable criteria. As others in this thread have noted, a high-level and ambiguous approach risks enabling scope minimization that could exclude critical system components or inherited services, either intentionally or inadvertently.\r\n\r\n## The Definition of \"federal information\" \r\nUnfortunately, so many parties involved in the ecosystem of FedRAMP have been burned by the term \"federal information\" that we're all gun shy to scope anything out of the conversation for fear of downstream repercussions. I can't tell you how many assessments I've been a part of where things like application metrics have been considered \"federal data\". Maybe they should have been? I was hoping that RFC 00010 would delve into that area, but didn't see it. \r\n\r\nHonestly, I think RFC 00010 is a great stride forward, and I would love to see more examples developed. In fact, I'd love to see an entire PMO \"library\" of use cases and examples that touch on specific cloud products, especially FedRAMP authorized cloud products. For example, \r\n\r\n- If I use a FedRAMP Moderate solution to monitor application metrics (data about application performance, which doesn't seem to fit the proposed \"federal data\" definition) for a FedRAMP High SaaS Application, is that okay? \r\n- I've personally witnessed different interpretations of this that had real-world ramifications to system configurations, and I'm not sure this RFC does much to clear that confusion up. \r\n\r\n```\r\nA. Information resources and metadata that do not meet condition (1) or (2) are outside the Minimum Assessment Scope.\r\n```\r\nUnfortunately, (2) is simply too vague to be actionable, and is completely open to interpretation. I think this leaves us in exactly the same position we're in today. \r\n\r\n**Potential Solution**\r\nPerhaps the creation of `Decision Trees` or `Flow-based Frameworks` could be helpful? These could be structed in a machine-readable format such as YAML and walk a CSP (and 3PAO) through a step-by-step decision-based workflow.  A simplified version would look like: \r\n\r\n```YAML\r\nDoes the component...\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Process or store federal data?\r\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Yes \u2192 Must be in scope.\r\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 No\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Enforce or fulfill a required control?\r\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Yes \u2192 Must be in scope.\r\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 No\r\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Provide inherited control functionality?\r\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Yes \u2192 Include supporting inheritance evidence.\r\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 No \u2192 May be out-of-scope.\r\n```\r\nThese decision trees could then be utilized in RFC 00010 to provide explicit, verifiable evidence regarding the decision points that were utilized to arrive to the conclusions reached in RFC 00010. \r\n\r\nContinued expansion of RFC 00010 in the \"library\" of examples I referenced above would be an awesome goal for FedRAMP. \r\n\r\n```\r\nB. If the cloud service uses information resources from other FedRAMP authorized or certified services then only the configuration and usage of those information resources is included in the Minimum Assessment Scope.\r\n```\r\nWhat's the difference between `FedRAMP authorized` and `certified services`. Until now it's been `authorized to level at or above that of the system`. The term \"certified\" seems to leave the door open for interpretation. The rest of the statement `only the configuration of the usage of those information resources` is also somewhat ambiguous. \r\n\r\nDoes this mean `configured in accordance with the CRM`? If not, what else does it mean and who determines that? Also, CRMs are an area that's incredibly varied in quality, accuracy and relevancy. There are many authorized CSP CRMs that do virtually nothing to inform a CSP leveraging them as to how the service needs to be configured in order to achieve FedRAMP compliance within their own architecture. \r\n\r\n**Potential Solution**\r\nThe language of the RFC needs to be a bit more explicit. If the expectation is the authorized service's CRM, explicit requirements around `what` needs to be included in a CRM need to be thought through. It would be great to see CRM's include explicit configuration instructions regarding expected configurations to meet FedRAMP requirements. A huge bonus would be a section that discusses how to `validate` those configurations, to make it easy on the 3PAO. The [Okta STIG](https://sec.okta.com/articles/2025/05/oktas-new-stig/), while not a CRM per se, is a wonderful example of a useful configuration guide that helps an end user achieve compliance utilizing a service. \r\n\r\n```\r\nC. If the cloud service uses information resources from other services that are not FedRAMP authorized or certified then all aspects of those services where (1) or (2) applies are included in the Minimum Assessment Scope.\r\n```\r\nThere's that term \"certified\" again. What are `all aspects of those services`? This is an area where I would really like to see RFC 00010 dive into in great detail. For example: \r\n\r\n- system utilizes a non-FedRAMP authorized service to provide SIEM capabilities (not recommended, but let's roll with it) - what \"aspects of those services\" are actually in Scope? Does the 3PAO need to test that SIEM organization's Personnel Security and Account Management controls? Or does this mean `in pursuit of the services it is providing to the system utilizing it`. If so, is that the AU controls, and controls associated with Encryption? \r\n\r\nSpecific use-case examples and the lists of controls that a 3PAO would be required to review and validate would be an awesome addition to RFC 00010, or a great novel RFC. \r\n\r\n```\r\nE. Information resources of the service offering may vary by impact level as appropriate to the level of information handled or impacted by the information resource so long as this is clearly identified and documented.\r\n``` \r\nIf I'm understanding this correctly, does this leave the door open to classify metadata as lower than the level of the federal data being processed by a system? For example, \r\n\r\n- A CSP has a SaaS that processes high federal data, and uses a FedRAMP authorized Moderate SaaS vulnerability scanner, but has categorized the metadata and data about the system (i.e., scan data) to be moderate, would this be an acceptable configuration? \r\n\r\n```\r\nF. Stakeholders should review best practices and technical assistance provided separately by FedRAMP for help with applying the Minimum Assessment Scope as needed.\r\n```\r\nThis idea makes sense - I really would like to see FedRAMP expend energy on explicitly defining specifications, with real-word examples based on actual FedRAMP authorized services. Building out a library of specific use-case examples and working with both CSPs and 3PAOs to determine acceptable configurations prior to the post-assessment process would be ideal. \r\n\r\nThe more specifications that are created - the faster the actual authorization process can become. So much of the current process delays are associated with working through unique configurations after the 3PAO has assessed the system and made decisions regarding control implementation due to lack of formal guidance. If all of that was ironed out pre-assessment, that a fully or semi-automated authorization process becomes entirely more feasible. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
