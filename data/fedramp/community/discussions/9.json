  "title": "Upcoming changes to KSIs in release materials",
  "body": "I wanted to share an update in advance as we approach the closing of the [public comment period on RFC-0006](https://www.fedramp.gov/rfcs/0006/) this weekend. It's important to note that rules around public comment restrict much of our ability to dynamically and publicly make changes during this process as this impedes the \"fair\" opportunity to everyone to provide comments on the same materials.\r\n\r\nHowever, given the nature of our pilot and the amount of work industry is doing to address draft KSIs, I feel that transparency here is in the interest of pilot participants.\r\n\r\n**None of the changes mentioned below are final.** We will continue to integrate and iterate based on comments received through the end of the public comment period.\r\n\r\n\\- Pete // FedRAMP Director\r\n\r\n---\r\nFor pilot participant awareness - _please take no action yet based on these, just be aware_:\r\n\r\n**There will be material changes to a number of the key security indicators and their validations.**\r\n\r\nLikely changes based on public comment to date include the following high level changes:\r\n\r\n1. The mappings to related NIST SP 800-53 Controls have been removed from the KSI standard. These will be provided and maintained separately in a related template, technical assistance, or best practice materials. \r\n\r\n2. Incident Response (KSI-IR) has been split into two separate KSIs - Recovery Planning (KSI-RP) and Incident Reporting (KSI-IR). \r\n  - The existing validations were split between these KSIs, reordered, and reworded for clarity in some instances\r\n  - Draft KSI-IR-6 has been removed\r\n  - A new validation to \"develop and maintain a recovery plan\" has been added\r\n\r\n3. Cloud Native Architecture (KSI-CNA) validations have been reordered and reworded for clarity and adjusted.\r\n  - In general these validations no longer direct use of specific technologies that may change (e.g. \"immutable containers\" -> \"immutable infrastructure\", \"firewalls/proxy servers\" -> \"edge systems\", \"logically segmented micro-services\" removed, etc.)\r\n  - The validation to execute continuous scanning of cloud native system components has been removed as redundant (see changes to KLI-MLA (4) below)\r\n\r\n4. Service Configuration (KSI-SC) validation 2 has been reworded for clarity.\r\n  - Instead of \"encrypt all network traffic\" it now reads \"encrypt _or otherwise secure_ network traffic _from unauthorized access_\"\r\n\r\n5. Identity and Access Management (KSI-IAM) validations have been reworded for clarity.\r\n  - We're actively tuning all of these to ensure they align with modern security best practices based on excellent feedback\r\n  - Zero Trust has been moved into IAM to ensure it applies across the entire infrastructure\r\n\r\n6. Monitoring, Logging, and Auditing (KSI-MLA) validations 1, 4, and 6 have been reworded for clarity.\r\n  - 1 adds \"Operate a SIEM _or similar system(s)_\" to clarify use of disparate components/services that provide SIEM capabilities in total are perfectly adequate even if it is not a marketed SIEM system\r\n  - 4 removed \"on publicly accessible\" clarifying that all components should be scanned. (see changes to CNA validation above)\r\n  - 6 clarifies that tracking and prioritization should be \"mitigation and/or remediation\" instead of just remediation\r\n\r\n7. Policy and Inventory (KSP-PI) validation 6 adds that security programs should have \"executive support\"\r\n\r\n8. Third Party Information Resources (KSI-3IR) has been re-acronymed as KSI-TP and validations have been reworded, reordered, and in some cases removed.\r\n  - Implement zero trust design principles has been moved to KSI-IAM\r\n  - The requirement to confirm third party resources have a Secure Software Development Attestation with CISA has been removed. This will be addressed differently in the future.\r\n  - The requirement for SBOMs has been removed. This will be addressed differently in the future.\r\n  - A requirement to \"identify all third party information resources\" has been added\r\n  - The requirement to confirm services storing federal information are FedRAMP authorized and configured securely has been updated to clarify it should address anything within the FedRAMP assessment scope (e.g. handles or likely to impact CIA of federal info)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPlease note, while we are happy to engage in Q&A on these changes here, if anything about these changes inspires a desire to add comments or opinions in general for us to formally consider on the record related to the _KSIs in the RFC_ then please post public comment on that (e.g. \"I really hope you keep X the same as in this RFC because A/B/C\" or whatever). Again, I realize this is weird, but we are required to consider public comment in a way that we aren't required to consider feedback in random Q&A and it is in the public's interest to leverage public comment.\r\n",

      "body": "A separate point to add because it comes up frequently: These may continue to change between the pilot and any final formalization of the authorization path, and the pilot will continue to be a bit fuzzy about how these capabilities should be implemented and assessed because the intent of the pilot is to understand innovative ways to do that. \r\n\r\n**FedRAMP will eventually be a bit more consistently prescriptive with this process before formalizing it** while still encouraging innovation, however that prescription will be based on real world learning during the pilot and still be limited in alignment with the [Executive Order on Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/06/2025-02345/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation) and related priorities for us.\r\n\r\nProviders who receive authorization as part of the Phase One pilot will be given reasonable advance warning of any pending changes that will require them to adjust KSIs, validations, evidence, approaches, etc. after authorization. \r\n\r\n",
