  "title": "Announcing a consolidated FedRAMP Community!",
  "body": "GitHub has been a successful home for our Community Working Groups over the past two months (and even longer for our RFCs), so we're carving out a bit of a comfier space for FedRAMP that will be more inviting and simple to approach. We've also found our four original Community Working Groups have been duplicating a lot of efforts and sometimes causing some confusion, so we're combining them into two main groups moving forward.\r\n\r\nFor more, check out today's blog post on two months of FedRAMP 20x: https://www.fedramp.gov/2025-04-24-fedramp-20x-two-months-in-and-taking-off/\r\n\r\nAnd if you'd rather see a quick summary, information about the FedRAMP Community is now easy to find at https://www.fedramp.gov/community/\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "To whom it may concern,\n\nI know RFC-006 is already closed and this may be too late as the KSIs are likely in front of the FedRAMP Board for final approval, but in case they're not...\n\nPlease consider disambiguating 3IR from Incident Response (IR). \n\nFor your consideration, I'd like to suggest KSI-3IT.01, etc. Or perhaps, KSI-3P.01, etc.\n\nThank you for your time. Keep up the great work!",
