  "body": "# RFC-0008 Continuous Reporting Standard\r\n\r\n> - Status: Closed\r\n> - Created By: FedRAMP PMO\r\n> - Start Date: 2025-05-09\r\n> - Closing Date: 2025-06-09\r\n> - Short Name: rfc-0008-continuous-reporting\r\n\r\n## Where to Comment\r\n\r\n- Discussion Thread: https://github.com/FedRAMP/rfcs/discussions/27\r\n- Public Comment Form: https://forms.gle/f5Aiu8chadAAQj8S6\r\n- Email: pete@fedramp.gov with the subject \"RFC-0008 Feedback\"\r\n\r\n## FedRAMP Guidance Types\r\n\r\n- **Standards** are base requirements that can be applied in any environment and will change rarely\r\n- **Best Practices** support standards with methods, techniques, or examples and may change often\r\n- **Technical Assistance** supports standards with additional technical nuance to support decision making and may change often\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThe Continuous Reporting Standard identifies Key Security Metrics that must be monitored by cloud service providers and made available to agencies and FedRAMP to maintain FedRAMP authorization. This standard is based on historical FedRAMP Rev 5 continuous monitoring standards that focused on direct scanning.\r\n\r\nThis standard also includes guidance on application, including requirements for how frequently Key Security Metrics should be reported. The standard does not propose specific formats or mechanisms for reporting this information at this time to encourage initial innovation by industry, but future updates may align towards best practices on presentation.\r\n\r\nNo action will be required of any cloud service provider without supporting guidance based on this FedRAMP Standard.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nTo ensure maximum reusability across agencies and encourage private sector innovation, continuous monitoring reporting must follow an objective data-driven approach that makes key security metrics easy for providers to collect and easy for agencies to monitor. \r\n\r\nContinuous Reporting should focus on information agencies need to know and will benefit from reviewing. The entire continuous monitoring and reporting process should encourage and empower engineering and security teams at providers to focus on maintaining and improving the security of their systems.\r\n\r\nThis standard begins a shift away from the government requiring cloud service providers to upload scan logs and create bespoke materials only for federal agencies. Reports following FedRAMP\u2019s Continuous Reporting Standard should mostly reuse information already monitored by provider security teams and can be made available to both commercial and government customers via the same mechanisms.\r\n\r\n## Explanation\r\n\r\nThe full draft technical assistance is approximately 5 pages and is available for review in the following formats:\r\n\r\n- [Basic web formatting on fedramp.gov](https://fedramp.gov/updates/rfcs/0008)\r\n- [Basic text markdown on GitHub](https://github.com/FedRAMP/rfcs/discussions/27)\r\n- PDF file: [rfc-0008-continuous-reporting-standard.pdf](https://github.com/FedRAMP/rfcs/raw/main/rfc/assets/0008-continuous-reporting-standard.pdf)\r\n- DOCX file: [rfc-0008-continuous-reporting-standard.docx](https://github.com/FedRAMP/rfcs/raw/main/rfc/assets/0008-continuous-reporting-standard.docx)\r\n\r\n## Discussion Requested\r\n\r\nThis draft standard is open for any public comment. FedRAMP encourages fast, informal comments from any member of the public. The public may submit multiple comments and may respond to other public comments. All comments from the public sent via email will be made public.\r\n\r\nThe FedRAMP Rev 5 Continuous Monitoring Working Group will simultaneously host discussions on potential best practices and implementation of the Continuous Reporting Standard.\r\n\r\nFedRAMP is particularly interested in comments regarding:\r\n\r\n- The reporting requirements are intended to be reasonable for both providers and agencies, facilitating innovation and informed risk analysis and acceptance. Do they strike the right balance between security oversight and operational efficiency?\r\n- This standard explicitly encourages that mitigated vulnerabilities be reported and tracked at their estimated risk rating after mitigation rather than their original risk rating. Is this a change in the right direction?\r\n- This approach is intended to give agencies adequate visibility into the overall security posture of a cloud service offering. What additional information might agencies need to maintain their risk awareness?\r\n- Standards will be supported separately by templates, best practices, technical assistance, and other materials. What materials might be prioritized for production to support this standard?\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# RFC-0008 Continuous Reporting Standard\r\n\r\nFriday, May 9th, 2025\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Background  \r\n[OMB Circular A-130: Managing Information as a Strategic Resource](https://whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/circulars/A130/a130revised.pdf) defines continuous monitoring as *\u201cmaintaining ongoing awareness of information security, vulnerabilities, threats, and incidents to support agency risk management decisions.\u201d*\r\n\r\n[The FedRAMP Authorization Act (44 USC \u00a7 3609 (a) (1))](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2023-title44/USCODE-2023-title44-chap36-sec3609) directs the Administrator of the General Services Administration to *\u201c... develop, coordinate, and implement a process to support agency review, reuse, and standardization, where appropriate, of security assessments of cloud computing products and services, including, as appropriate, oversight of continuous monitoring of cloud computing products and services\u2026\u201d* This responsibility is [delegated to the FedRAMP Director](https://www.gsa.gov/directives-library/gsa-delegations-of-authority-fedramp). \r\n\r\n# Introduction\r\n\r\nThis FedRAMP standard establishes an updated continuous monitoring reporting process for FedRAMP authorized cloud service providers that requires cloud service providers to maintain direct relationships with their customers for reporting purposes and reduce the burden for continuous monitoring by agencies. Agencies must follow OMB policy and NIST standards when adopting FedRAMP authorized cloud services, including maintaining an ongoing awareness of the security posture of services they use. Providers must ensure such information is available directly to agencies and regularly review it with all participating agencies.\r\n\r\nTo ensure maximum reusability across agencies and encourage private sector innovation, continuous monitoring reporting must follow an objective data-driven approach that makes key security metrics easy for providers to collect and easy for agencies to monitor. Reporting should focus on information agencies need to know and will benefit from reviewing. The entire continuous monitoring and reporting process should encourage and empower engineering and security teams at providers to focus on maintaining and improving the security of their systems.\r\n\r\nThis updated standard creates a new Continuous Reporting Standard that replaces some parts of previous FedRAMP guidance related to reporting on continuous monitoring activities for all FedRAMP authorizations and certifications, including the current Rev 5 Agency Authorization process and FedRAMP 20x. Best practices and technical assistance to help stakeholders follow this standard will be provided separately. \r\n\r\nThis standard does not change the continuous monitoring requirements identified in a provider\u2019s security plan; it only changes the reporting requirements. Additional information on how these requirements will change overall and align to emerging standards such as the Significant Change Notification Standard will be provided prior to final formalization of this standard.\r\n\r\nNo action will be required of any cloud service provider without supporting guidance based on this FedRAMP Standard.\r\n\r\n# Continuous Reporting  \r\nThe FedRAMP Continuous Reporting Standard establishes requirements for continuous reporting that cloud service providers MUST follow to maintain FedRAMP authorization. \r\n\r\nAt least the following Key Security Metrics MUST be included in continuous monitoring reports:\r\n\r\n1. **Unmitigated Vulnerabilities** \\- A list of unmitigated vulnerabilities or vulnerability groupings, broken down by risk rating, including at least the following information: \r\n\r\n   1. Total number of unmitigated items  \r\n   2. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID, other unique ID if CVE is unavailable, or N/A  \r\n   3. Provider\u2019s unique tracking identifier for this occurrence  \r\n   4. Component or Services impacted  \r\n   5. Original FedRAMP remediation window end date  \r\n   6. Known Exploited Vulnerability status   \r\n   7. Remediation and/or mitigation plans, including dates\r\n\r\n2. **Mitigated Vulnerabilities** \\- A list of mitigated vulnerabilities or vulnerability groups, broken down by estimated risk rating after mitigation, including at least the following information:\r\n\r\n   1. Total number of mitigated items  \r\n   2. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID, other unique ID if CVE is unavailable, or N/A  \r\n   3. Provider\u2019s unique tracking identifier for this occurrence  \r\n   4. Component or Services impacted  \r\n   5. Original risk rating prior to mitigation  \r\n   6. Explanation of mitigation measures  \r\n   7. Date mitigation took effect  \r\n   8. Original FedRAMP remediation window end date  \r\n   9. Known Exploited Vulnerability status  \r\n   10. Remediation plan, including dates\r\n\r\n3. **Incidents** \\- Information about any incident-related activities in the past reporting period or past 30 days (whichever is longer)\r\n\r\n4. **Significant Change Notifications** \\- Information about any Significant Change Notifications in the past reporting period or past 30 calendar days (whichever is longer)\r\n\r\n5. **Upcoming Milestones** \\- Information about any upcoming planned service milestones and third-party assessment activities within the next 60 calendar days that are not included in Significant Change Notifications   \r\n     \r\n6. **Overall Scan Coverage** \\- Overall numbers and percentage of distinct component configurations covered by the service\u2019s security scanning activities\r\n\r\n7. **Detailed Component Scan Coverage** \\- Numbers and percentage of components covered by the services\u2019s security scanning activities grouped by distinct component type and scan type\r\n\r\n# Application of the Continuous Reporting Standard\r\n\r\n1. Providers MUST make Key Security Metrics available to agencies and FedRAMP in similar human-readable and compatible machine-readable formats. These formats SHOULD follow FedRAMP best practices and technical assistance to ensure maximum reusability.\r\n\r\n2. Providers MUST update Key Security Metrics at least monthly.\r\n\r\n3. Providers MUST keep Key Security Metrics available to agencies and FedRAMP for 24 months after initial reporting.\r\n\r\n4. Providers SHOULD update Key Security Metrics one week before monthly monitoring meetings to ensure information is timely and agencies and FedRAMP have the opportunity to review in advance.\r\n\r\n5. Providers SHOULD make Key Security Metrics available within their standard customer portals, protected with appropriate controls to ensure agencies and FedRAMP can make this information available to their information security staff.\r\n\r\n6. Providers SHOULD mitigate vulnerability risk as quickly as possible. Providers SHOULD adjust vulnerability severity based on documented mitigation.\r\n\r\n7. Providers, third-party assessment organizations, agencies, and FedRAMP SHOULD consider mitigated vulnerabilities at their mitigated risk rating. Providers MAY carry mitigated vulnerabilities beyond FedRAMP remediation windows for the original risk rating without penalty but MUST remediate such vulnerabilities once it is reasonable to do so. \r\n\r\n8. Providers SHOULD NOT include validated false positives in security reporting to agencies and FedRAMP. Providers MUST maintain documented evidence for determinations of false positives for the duration of their existence.  \r\n     \r\n9. Providers MAY make Key Security Metrics available to other customers or the public if they determine doing so will not have a likely impact on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of federal information. \r\n\r\n10. Providers MAY provide additional security relevant metrics in their reporting as they deem appropriate for sharing with agencies and FedRAMP.\r\n\r\n11. All parties SHOULD follow FedRAMP\u2019s best practices and technical assistance on continuous reporting where applicable.\r\n\r\n# Exceptions to the Continuous Monitoring Reporting Requirements\r\n\r\nProviders MAY be required to provide additional metrics beyond those identified above as a condition of a formal FedRAMP Corrective Action Plan or other agreements with federal agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This reflects real-world operational risk more accurately than original severity alone. To support this change:\n\n\t\u2022\tRecommend publishing a scoring rubric or example scenarios showing acceptable mitigation techniques (e.g., compensating controls like WAFs, network segmentation, exploit path reduction).\n\t\u2022\tInclude optional fields in reporting templates to show the rationale for adjusted risk scores (e.g., threat intelligence, vulnerability reachability analysis).\n\n\nAdditional Data for Agency Risk Awareness\n\nAgencies may benefit from supplemental metrics such as:\n\n\t\u2022\tExploitability trends (e.g., Known Exploited Vulnerabilities per month).\n\t\u2022\tCoverage gaps between inventory and scanning tools.\n\t\u2022\tMean Time to Mitigation (MTTM) or trend lines for aging vulnerabilities.\n\t\u2022\tIntegration with API-based dashboards (e.g., Power BI, Elastic, or custom security portals) could allow agencies to visualize Key Security Metrics over time.\n\n\nSuggested Support Materials\n\nTo enable widespread adoption, the following artifacts should be prioritized:\n\n\t1.\tGitHub-based open-source reference implementation using Terraform, AWS, Azure, or Kubernetes components mapped to KSM outputs.\n\t2.\tJSON Schema definitions for each KSM metric and validation tools.\n\t3.\tSample CI/CD pipeline YAMLs (e.g., GitLab, GitHub Actions) demonstrating automated KSM generation, export, and visualization.\n\t4.\tMaturity model or self-assessment guide for CSPs to evaluate readiness to adopt the Continuous Reporting Standard.\n\n\nFinal Notes\n\nTo further reinforce success:\n\n\t\u2022\tRecommend tie-in with FedRAMP 20x and FedRAMP OSCAL adoption timelines.\n\t\u2022\tConsider a phased rollout with voluntary participation before full enforcement.\n\t\u2022\tEncourage shared services providers to publish anonymized aggregated metrics to promote industry benchmarking and transparency.\n\nThank you again for leading this forward-looking shift in continuous monitoring.",

      "body": "1. Vulnerability reachability context has become increasingly important in understanding real vulnerability risk (and thus the necessity of urgent/non-urgent remediation or mitigation). How should providers account for \"vulnerability reachability?\" Is it appropriate to document that as part of an \"Explanation of mitigation measures\" (even if it isn't explicitly a mitigation measure that was intentionally applied?\")\r\n2. Including KEV context is useful for better understanding vulnerability risk. What about also requiring the inclusion of EPSS when it's available, since it is becoming more widely adopted in the industry (both in terms of internal security teams using it more and also vulnerability management products incorporating them more)?\r\n3. What are relevant examples of \"vulnerability groupings\" or \"vulnerability groups?\" This seems too open to interpretation and could result in wildly different approaches being used by providers that could create excessive complexity for assessors to understand across their portfolio of providers\r\n4. This standard seems excessively focused on vulnerability scanning. What about other essential and common security controls types, such as threat detection/monitoring controls, data encryption controls, etc? It would be beneficial to enumerate other universally-relevant baseline security controls for providers to include Key Security Metrics about\r\n5. It would be beneficial to provide a general taxonomy of Key Security Metric Types to make it easier to describe what kinds of metrics should be provided for different concerns. For example: Control Coverage Metrics (what percentage of in-scope components are being scanned/monitored/protected by this control vs. not), Risk Reduction metrics (what percentage of security \"findings\" for this control type were remediated/mitigated/resolved within a defined SLA?), etc.\r\n\r\n",

But I do not believe most models have enough data to provide a true and realistic risk rating. Hence we see rapid up/down changes in patching requirements. I suggest we focus on remediation trends such as coverage, patching timeliness over 3, 6 or 12 months. Vulnerability management can then receive the same scrutiny as the other manual control findings. After all, RA-5 is only a part of the CSP's complete security posture.",

This requires a deeper level of sophistication to implement and manage in a dynamic environment than I expected of a monthly metric. It also feels like a more forensic metric, not a continuous monitoring metric.\r\nWas this a specific request from agencies? Or was it added in as a nice-to-have? If agencies requested it, What value is being derived from this monthly view that isn't derived from 6 or other mtetrics? Does that value tie to direct security outcomes or to customer perception? I would further ask if the value derived justifies the breakdown, automation, and reporting required to support this metric.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation given the above is to remove this point but interested to hear if there are other points of view on this.",

Do they strike the right balance between security oversight and operational efficiency?\r\n\r\n> For providers that do not or cannot have most of the metrics or data collection for metrics automated, there will be considerable overhead. A better balance could be achieved by focusing on higher risk vulnerabilities that exceed general risk thresholds for agencies, rather than listing all unmitigated vulnerabilities. Additionally, for lower risk vulnerabilities, reporting could be limited to overdue (past SLA) vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities with exceptions.\r\n\r\nThis standard explicitly encourages that mitigated vulnerabilities be reported and tracked at their estimated risk rating after mitigation rather than their original risk rating. Is this a change in the right direction?\r\n\r\n> Mitigation should be reworded or defined in this document. It should be risk adjusted due to mitigating factors as a misunderstanding could occur meaning remediation.\r\nThe risk reporting SLA should be based on mitigating factors and not the original risk rating. CSP\u2019s should have the ability to take into account external vendor recommendations (e.g., RedHat, Microsoft, Google, etc.) and risk downgrades/ratings, compensating controls, location of the affected assets within the system architecture, additional protections in place, and available attack vectors to exploit the vulnerability on the asset. For instance, CVE-2024-36896 can be considered as a \u201cCritical\u201d risk on the NVD site (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-36896), however, vendors with additional information in regards to the CVE could consider the risk at a lower level such as \u201cLow\u201d (https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2024-36896)\r\nEvaluating risk based on current vulnerability status (mitigated, unmitigated, etc.) enables more relevant decision making concerning risk acceptance or whether post-mitigated vulnerabilities persist as high risks that require additional mitigation efforts or if adequate protections for both the CSP environment and customer data are implemented to limit any risk or exposure.\r\n\r\nThis approach is intended to give agencies adequate visibility into the overall security posture of a cloud service offering. What additional information might agencies need to maintain their risk awareness?\r\n\r\n> How often scans are conducted, how many OS and container images a CSP is managing, how often vulnerabilities are out of SLA, when a fix was made available from the vendor, and most important how many vendor dependencies. An aggregate number compiled about a vendor who does not release a patch will help with removal of / ban of specific packages (supply chain risk). \r\n\r\nStandards will be supported separately by templates, best practices, technical assistance, and other materials. What materials might be prioritized for production to support this standard?\r\n\r\n> For agencies, guidance on how continuous reporting informs their risk assessment and management processes. For CSPs, what APIs or connections will be required to share with the agencies or the PMO. The biggest change will be the lack of structure/standardization which ultimately helps streamline how the right data is provided. The list of the data an agency or the PMO will need, will allow the CSPs to craft a methodology to provide it. \r\n\r\n**Continuous Reporting**\r\n\r\n> Number of vendor dependencies - the PMO should aggregate a number of vendors",

Would like to validate the differences:\r\n\r\n### Differences\r\n`Reporting for DR types and Vendor Dependencies:`\r\n**from: Application of the Continuous Reporting Standard**\r\n```Providers SHOULD NOT include validated false positives in security reporting to agencies and FedRAMP. Providers MUST maintain documented evidence for determinations of false positives for the duration of their existence.```\r\n\r\nRemoving the bloat is great, but leaves on the table requirements for how the false positives that have not been approved, be reported (as with a mitigation or without a mitigation).  It is requesting evidence.  Is that to be submitted in another reporting format? (Supporting documents was not listed as requirement for mitigation findings.  \r\n\r\n```Recommend detailing the accepted mitigation types, and provide structured requirements on how to handle the in-process false positives.```\r\n\r\n`Reporting only for active`\r\nConfirm that the KSI reporting only requires active findings.\r\n\r\n`Asset identifier - converted to count:`\r\nBased on the new Requirement: Total number of unmitigated items, it should instead be just a count.  \r\nThis is great!\r\n\r\n`Additional reduced reporting: Columns from FedRAMP POA&M Tracker that are no-longer required:`\r\nconfirmation that these no longer have a use case.  While the requirement states that additional detail can be provided, these are NOT covered under the reporting requirements.  Assuming they can be removed.  \r\n- Controls\r\n- Point of Contact\r\n- Resources Required\r\n- Status Date\r\n- Supporting Documents\r\n- Comments\r\n- Auto-Approve\r\n- Vendor Dependency\r\n- Last Vendor Check-in Date\r\n- Vendor Dependent Product Name\r\n\r\n## Sections 3-5 (Incidents, Significant Change Notifications, Upcoming Milestones)\r\nWhile this is good for a directive, or a policy.  It does not contain enough details for explicit requirements.  \r\n\r\n```To support standardized data deliverables, recommending that these sections are clarified with additinal detail, like what was provided in sections 1 and 2, to ensure Application Standards and requirements are met.```  \r\n\r\nIn Incidents, it says `incident-related activities` does that mean training and exercises?  \r\nOr, are you only looking for what is currently reported in the FedRAMP Monthly ConMon Executive Summary.  \r\n\r\n## Sections 6-7 (Scan Coverage)\r\nI like where this is going, but would like some additional clarity on the component definitions.  \r\n\r\n```Recommend Leveraging the OSCAL definitions for component types to standardize and support reciprocity```\r\nhttps://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL-Reference/models/v1.1.3/plan-of-action-and-milestones/json-reference/#/plan-of-action-and-milestones/local-definitions/components/type\r\n\r\n# Overall Questions/Comments:\r\n- Are Operational Requirements no longer supported (will they just be open and overdue and only mitigations if included in a Risk Adjustment) or will Operational Requirements be mitigations with an an expiration date?\r\n- Any requirements for evidence files/ supporting documentation (scan files) or just coverage? Are you requesting the artifacts in a specific format to support computer readable?\r\n- Bundling compliance findings under a single POAM, \r\n\r\n# OSCAL Submission (Computer readable requirement)\r\nWith the above as assumptions, this could be a way of programmatically submitting the reporting requirement, using the NIST OSCAL format.  Below is a build out of Continuous Reporting Requirements 1-7.  Some have blank props or links, that could/should be built out with requirements.  \r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"plan-of-action-and-milestones\": {\r\n        \"uuid\": \"Identifies unique report\",\r\n

      "body": "_Public comment submitted via email by Adobe (plain text copy/paste from a PDF, apologies for formatting):_\r\n\r\nAdobe appreciates the opportunity to provide feedback on RFC-0008, the proposed Continuous Reporting\r\nStandard.1 We commend the FedRAMP PMO for its continued efforts to modernize and streamline the reporting\r\nprocess in ways that support both agency oversight and cloud service provider (CSP) innovation. Below are\r\nAdobe\u2019s comments on the draft standard.\r\n\r\n1. Vulnerability Groupings\r\n\r\nAdobe supports the inclusion of vulnerability groupings in Sections 1 and 2 of the Key Security Metrics. Grouping\r\nvulnerabilities by shared characteristics\u2014such as common root cause, affected component, or remediation\r\nstrategy\u2014improves clarity, reduces administrative overhead, and enhances the actionability of reports. This\r\napproach aligns with how many modern security teams manage vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n2. Component and Mitigation Reporting\r\n\r\nSections 1(4) and 2(4) of the Key Security Metrics require reporting on \u201ccomponents or services impacted,\u201d and\r\nSection 2(6) requires an \u201cexplanation of mitigation measures.\u201d We recommend the PMO clarify the expected\r\nlevel of specificity for these fields while considering: 1) Overly detailed disclosures may inadvertently expose\r\nsensitive architectural information; and 2) Mitigation explanations may include proprietary or security-sensitive\r\ndetails that a bad actor could misuse.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, referencing component categories (e.g., \u201capplication tier\u201d or \u201cdatabase service\u201d) may be sufficient\r\nfor agency risk analysis without disclosing sensitive implementation details. If categories are not deemed\r\nsufficient, we suggest the PMO add flexibility to the language in Section 1(4), 2(4) and 2(6) such as \u201cto the extent\r\nsuch reporting is not reasonably expected to enable misuse by parties that could harm CSPs or its customers\".\r\nWe recommend that the PMO provide guidance or examples in best practice materials to help CSPs balance\r\ntransparency with operational security.\r\n\r\n3. Scan Coverage Metrics\r\n\r\nSections 6 and 7 of the Key Security Metrics require reporting on scan coverage, including the percentage of\r\ncomponents covered by security scanning. This is an expansion on current FedRAMP POA&M reporting, which\r\ndoes not include scan coverage metrics. While we understand the intent to provide agencies with a broader\r\nview of system health, we recommend clarifying how these metrics will be interpreted and used in risk\r\nassessments.\r\n\r\nIn general, scan coverage data is not always a reliable proxy for organizations\u2019 security posture. Scan coverage\r\ndata can vary significantly depending on an organization\u2019s system architecture, scanning tool capabilities,\r\naccessibility of hosts by the scanner, use of ephemeral technologies, and other factors. As a result, scan\r\ncoverage data can be very system-specific and not easy to generalize to an industry threshold. Without context,\r\nthese metrics may be misinterpreted or lead to inconsistent expectations across agencies. We suggest that scan\r\ncoverage reporting be accompanied by guidance developed with industry input regarding acceptable thresholds,\r\npotentially based on qualitative rather than quantitative methodology.\r\n\r\n4. Reporting of Mitigated Vulnerabilities\r\n\r\nWe support the shift in Section 2 of the Key Security Metrics toward reporting mitigated vulnerabilities at their\r\nestimated post-mitigation risk rating rather than their original severity. This change reflects a more mature, risk-\r\ninformed approach to vulnerability management and aligns with industry practices. It also reduces the likelihood of inflated POA&M inventories that do not accurately reflect residual risk.\r\nWe encourage the PMO to reinforce this approach in future updates to the POA&M template and related\r\nguidance, designed to ensure consistency across reporting mechanisms.\r\n\r\n5. False Positive Reporting\r\n\r\nSection 8 of the Application of the Continuous Reporting Standard instructs CSPs to not include validated false\r\npositives in security reporting. We encourage the PMO to clarify that false positives should be absent from any\r\nreporting after validation, and not appear in the \u201cClosed Item\u201d tab of the POA&M.\r\n\r\n6. Incident Reporting\r\n\r\nSection 3 of the Key Security Metrics would establish a new requirement to include \u201cinformation about any\r\nincident-related activities\u201d in continuous monitoring reports. This is very broad language that should be\r\nbalanced against unnecessary over-reporting as well as the security risks of disclosing sensitive information. It is\r\nunclear why this requirement is included when CSPs have existing incident reporting requirements to authorized\r\nagencies via contract and other regulatory frameworks. We encourage the PMO to remove this requirement, or\r\nto significantly narrow the scope of the details required and allow for reciprocity with other incident reporting\r\nrequirements. We recommend the PMO consider adding a carveout to the language in Section 3 such as \u201cto the\r\nextent such reporting is not reasonably expected to enable misuse by parties that could harm CSPs or its\r\ncustomers\".\r\n\r\n7. Customer Portal\r\n\r\nUnder the current continuous reporting process, CSPs typically upload POA&Ms to connect.gov. Section 5 of the\r\nApplication of the Continuous Reporting Standard instructs CSPs to make the Key Security Metrics available\r\nwithin their standard customer portals. We appreciate that the PMO envisions enabling CSPs to have additional\r\nflexibility in how Key Security Metrics are made available. However, the PMO should clarify whether this would\r\nrequire that the customer portal also be FedRAMP authorized to securely store this type of data, as connect.gov\r\npresently is. We also encourage the PMO to continue to consider connect.gov as a viable alternative for CSPs\r\nwhose customer portals are not FedRAMP authorized.\r\n\r\n8. Balancing Oversight and Efficiency\r\n\r\nOverall, we believe RFC-0008 strikes a reasonable balance between security oversight and operational\r\nefficiency. The emphasis on reuse across agencies, grouping vulnerabilities, machine-readable formats, and\r\nrisked-based reporting is especially welcome. However, as noted above, we recommend that the PMO prioritize\r\nthe following clarifications to the standard or supporting materials designed to ensure successful\r\nimplementation:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Guidance for scan coverage reporting;\r\n\u2022 Updating POA&M guidance to reflect risk-based reporting of mitigated vulnerabilities;\r\n\u2022 Provide details regarding treatment of validated false positives;\r\n\u2022 Narrowing the scope of incident reporting and providing for reciprocity with other reporting\r\nrequirements; and\r\n\u2022 Maintaining connect.gov as a continuous reporting channel.\r\n* * *\r\nAdobe appreciates the PMO\u2019s thoughtful approach to modernizing continuous monitoring. We believe RFC-0008\r\nis a step in the right direction and look forward to collaborating further as the standard is finalized and\r\nimplemented.\r\n",

      "body": "Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Continuous\u202fReporting Standard.\u202f\r\nFedRAMP\u2019s 20x vision of objective, real time, evidence driven oversight, is exactly what Cybersecurity\u202fPerformance\u202fManagement (CPM) was designed to deliver. First highlighted by Gartner\u00ae as a high benefit approach for dynamically reducing and communicating cyber risk, CPM complements, and scales with, established frameworks such as RMF, ISO\u202f27001, NIST\u202fCSF, CMMC, CIS\u202fControls, and CISA\u202fCPGs. It gives organizations a practical, performance centric layer that unifies those standards into a single, continuously managed picture of cyber readiness. To operationalize CPM, TDI has developed a rich catalogue of Cybersecurity\u202fPerformance\u202fIndicators (CPIs), quantitative, goal based metrics that stream telemetry from existing tools into actionable insight on risk, compliance, maturity, and ROI.\r\n\r\nThe current proposed metric set is largely volume based. To complete the picture, we suggest adding at least one timeliness or performance metric, such as Mean\u202fTime\u202fto\u202fRemediate critical CVEs (MTTR CVE). Including a speed of fix indicator allows agencies to see how quickly issues are resolved, not just how many exist, and highlights providers that actively drive down risk.\r\n\r\nWe endorse FedRAMP\u2019s intent to reuse continuous monitoring data across frameworks, particularly DoD\u2019s Software\u202fFast\u202fTrack (SWFT). True reciprocity, however, depends on identical metric definitions and thresholds. We encourage the PMO to engage early with SWFT and civilian agency stakeholders to harmonize terminology (e.g., \u201cscan coverage\u201d) so providers can maintain a single data pipeline for multiple authorizations.\r\n\r\nTo maintain full risk awareness, agencies might also benefit from trend views (e.g., 90 day trajectories of high severity vulnerabilities) and brief incident outcome summaries that demonstrate lessons learned. These additions would complement the required metrics and bolster situational awareness.\r\n\r\nWe find the Continuous\u202fReporting Standard to be a well considered step toward real time, performance based security oversight. With the addition of a timeliness metric and early coordination on metric definitions across programs, FedRAMP can deliver meaningful insight while keeping provider overhead reasonable. TDI looks forward to supporting and collaborating on making this model a success. Thank you for considering our feedback.",

Providers, third-party assessment organizations, agencies, and FedRAMP SHOULD consider mitigated vulnerabilities at their mitigated risk rating. Providers MAY carry mitigated vulnerabilities beyond FedRAMP remediation windows for the original risk rating without penalty but MUST remediate such vulnerabilities once it is reasonable to do so.  \r\n\r\nOur interpretation of \"mitigated vulnerabilities\" are issues that are historically submitted for risk adjustment or as an operational requirement. Handling mitigated vulnerabilities in this manner could result in risk being carried for far longer than they feasibly should by both the CSP and agency. Compliance teams within CSPs often need to rely on firm requirements to ensure issues are mitigated/remediated in a timely manner. These teams may have a difficult time getting adequate prioritization internally because there aren't firm requirements and `once it's reasonable to do so` could be easily taken advantage of to buy more time or simply avoid addressing the issue. \r\n\r\nIn short, the way this is defined would give compliance teams less leverage internally to have risks addressed in a timely manner.",

      "body": "Comment received via email:\r\n\r\n    Clarification on Mitigated Vulnerabilities vs. Existing Risk Adjustment Process\r\n        We request clarification on the distinction between \"Mitigated Vulnerabilities\" as defined in RFC-0008 and the current risk adjustment process. Specifically, how does this new concept differ from the existing practice where compensating or mitigating controls are documented to adjust a vulnerability's risk level (e.g., from High to Moderate)?\r\n    Integration of Vendor Dependencies and Operational Requirements\r\n        Could you please elaborate on how the concepts of Vendor Dependencies or Operational Requirements are incorporated into the new paradigm of reporting on Mitigated and Unmitigated Vulnerabilities?\r\n    Reporting Status of Manual Control Findings\r\n        Will providers continue to report on the status of manual control findings as part of the new continuous monitoring standard outlined in RFC-0008?\r\n    Scope of Vulnerability Reporting and Management of Closed Items\r\n        For clarity, please confirm that under the new standard, providers will primarily report on open, existing security vulnerabilities. Does this imply that the practice of reporting on 'Closed' POA&M items and tracking them indefinitely will be discontinued?\r\n    Standardization of Machine-Readable Formats\r\n        We recommend the explicit detailing and enforcement of a specific machine-readable format (or formats) that all participating agencies must accept. Without a mandated standard, there is a risk of an unmanageable proliferation of formats across the industry. This could lead to a situation where providers must generate artifacts in numerous different formats to satisfy the varying maturity levels and ingestion capabilities of their customer agencies.\r\n    Guidance on Vulnerability Groupings\r\n        RFC-0008 mentions that vulnerabilities may be provided individually or in vulnerability groupings. We request further guidance on how providers may group vulnerabilities to prevent significant disparities in implementation across the industry. Additionally, does the concept of \"vulnerability grouping\" imply that a single POA&M item can address multiple related CVEs?\r\n    Definition of \"Percentage of Distinct Component Configurations\"\r\n        We request clarification on the term \"percentage of distinct component configurations\" as it relates to \"Overall Scan Coverage.\" Specifically, are these considered unique assets/components, or is a more granular definition intended?\r\n    Carrying Mitigated Vulnerabilities Beyond Remediation Windows\r\n        RFC-0008 states, \"Providers MAY carry mitigated vulnerabilities beyond FedRAMP remediation windows for the original risk rating without penalty but MUST remediate such vulnerabilities once it is reasonable to do so.\" We seek clarification on the guardrails defining what FedRAMP considers \"reasonable\" in this context. Furthermore, if a POA&M is carried past its due date because it has been deemed \"reasonable\" to do so, will this POA&M still be categorized as \"overdue\" and potentially contribute to FedRAMP escalatory actions, such as a Detail Findings Review or a Corrective Action Plan?\r\n    Availability and Reporting of Key Security Metrics\r\n        RFC-0008 states, \"Providers MUST keep Key Security Metrics available to agencies and FedRAMP for 24 months after initial reporting\" and \"Providers SHOULD make Key Security Metrics available within their standard customer portals, protected with appropriate controls to ensure agencies and FedRAMP can make this information available to their information security staff.\" We note that some of this information may already be addressed via existing ConMon Package uploads (e.g., to USDA Connect). If KSMs are maintained within USDA Connect, do providers need to maintain additional copies elsewhere in order to satisfy 24 month retention requirements?\r\n\r\n",

Our recommendations reflect the operational reality of  running secure cloud services at scale and our experience as a global  SaaS running Continuous Monitoring (ConMon) for more than a  decade. As a result of this lived experience, Qualys, a leading  vulnerability management company, has extended its focus to  execute on risk-based methods for managing cybersecurity risk. This  analysis explains why, and how we might work together to realize the  vision and strategy of FedRAMP 20X. \r\n\r\n**Executive Summary** \r\n\r\nCurrent ConMon practices place outsized emphasis on vulnerability  management, driven entirely by CVSS scores. This narrow focus  undermines broader risk management goals and consumes scarce  engineering resources that should be allocated to activities with  higher security returns: architecture reviews, secure design, threat  modeling, and control implementation. \r\n\r\nFedRAMP should evolve ConMon and POA\\&M guidance to reflect a  holistic approach to security posture monitoring that drives increased  risk reduction for the government by focusing on hardening (secure  configurations, defense-in-depth, resiliency engineering) and  increasing the continuous monitoring scope to assess other critical  controls through automation. This includes integrating configuration  management, asset management, software security, and modern  risk-based prioritization capabilities to identify the risks that truly  matter. ConMon should also evolve to include continuous monitoring  of threat exposures that are not identified as vulnerabilities \u2013 e.g., \r\n\r\n![][image2]  \r\ndatabases exposed to the Internet, week credentials that lack multi factor authentication, etc. \r\n\r\nThe government benefits when CSPs can shift to strategies that  reduce noise from non-exploitable vulnerabilities and pull in  additional signals that present weaknesses in the context of risk. This  allows CSPs to unlock time which is otherwise wasted on remediation  of non-exploitable issues at the expense of architecture reviews,  threat modeling, secure by design initiatives, and control  \r\n\r\nenhancements, and other risk reducing activities. \r\n\r\n**Problem** \r\n\r\nVulnerability volume continues to grow\u2014over 19,000 CVEs in 2025  alone\u2014but only \\~6% are exploited.1 More impactful, 78% were still  ranked High/Critical by CVSS.2 On average, attackers have 11.1 days of  exploitation opportunities before organizations begin patching,3 largely due to a growing bottomless backlog of CVEs. Yet ConMon  requires CSPs to address vulnerabilities as if all pose equal risk in the  same classification level (For example, a high finding of Log4j should  carry higher weight than a high finding , leading to the elimination of  capacity for initiatives outside vulnerability management. Teams  spend the bulk of their limited security time remediating non exploitable issues rather than investing in high-value security  outcomes like system hardening and Secure by Design. \r\n\r\nIf we leverage the MITRE ATT\\&CK Framework as a model, we can see  that tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries  \r\n\r\n1 Cyentia Institute: https://www.cyentia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/EPSS-Exploration Of-Exploits.pdf 2 Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams: https://www.first.org/epss/data\\_stats 3 Qualys TruRisk Research Report 2023: https://www.qualys.com/forms/tru-research-report/![][image3]  \r\nare most mapped to controls in the SI, SC, and AC control families. Yet, POA\\&Ms **narrowly** focus on CVE management. \r\n\r\nA CVSS-driven model has proven insufficient. It lacks business  context, does not reflect real-world exploitability, and encourages  activity without delivering a true security impact. Security should not  be measured in the volume of closed tickets, but in risk reduced. \r\n\r\nToday\u2019s ConMon and POA\\&M processes are not just unproductive\u2014 they are often counterproductive. They divert critical security and  remediation capacity away from high-impact activities such as  secure-by-design, threat modeling, and control implementation.  When teams are forced to remediate issues solely to satisfy  compliance\u2014despite clear evidence of negligible or no risk\u2014it  undermines the broader mission of hardening systems and software.  To deliver meaningful security outcomes, organizations must reclaim  time budgets currently consumed by checklist-driven reporting and  reinvest them into efforts that actually reduce risk. \r\n\r\n**Where Do We Want To Go?** \r\n\r\nThe goal of ConMon should be to eliminate or mitigate risk, not to  simply drive down vulnerabilities that pose little risk to loss exposure. Agencies need adequate visibility into the overall security posture of a  cloud service offering \u2013 CVEs are only part of the story. We encourage  the FedRAMP 20X initiative to set a bold vision for risk management. Below is a possible model to do just that, which can be  complimented through open APIs and standard reporting formats.\r\n\r\n![][image4]  \r\n![][image5]**A Call to Modernize ConMon** Security posture is broader than vulnerability counts. FedRAMP  should expand the POA\\&M and ConMon scope to require evidence of: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Configuration management conformance (e.g., DISA STIGs, CIS  Benchmarks) \r\n\r\n\u2022 Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)4 and/or Cloud  Security Posture Management (CSPM) capabilities to address  hardening, configuration management, and asset management. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Software security and test automation practices (e.g., NIST SSDF) \u2022 Application Security posture, because everything is software. \u2022 Software provenance and build system security (e.g. SLSA)5 \u2022 Policy mandate enforcement and asset discovery \\+ intelligence \u2022 Contextual threat modeling using frameworks like MITRE ATT\\&CK \r\n\r\n4 Security Content Automation Protocol: https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/security-content automation-protocol 5 Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts: https://slsa.dev/\r\n\r\n![][image6]  \r\n\u2022 Improved communication on the disposition of vulnerabilities (e.g.  Vulnerability-Exploitability eXchange (VEX))6 \r\n\r\nCSPs need flexibility to prioritize. This is not a call to lower the bar \u2013 but to raise it in ways that drive real security outcomes. Vulnerability  management is only part of the puzzle. \r\n\r\n**From Output to Outcome** \r\n\r\nTools like Qualys TruRisk provide a model for this shift. By combining  CVSS with exploitability data (EPSS), threat intelligence, asset details, business criticality, and exposure context, TruRisk enables: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Deprioritizing low-risk CVEs with high CVSS but no exploit path \u2022 Elevating real threats with low CVSS but high mission impact \u2022 POA\\&M export with risk justification based \u2013 not static \\- scores \r\n\r\nTruRisk delivers defensible prioritization and unlocks security capacity  for CSPs to do the work that makes a difference. \r\n\r\n**Recommendations** \r\n\r\nQualys recommends a two-pronged approach to advance the  objectives outlined in RFC-0008. \r\n\r\nFirst, we support the FedRAMP PMO moving forward with policy  updates that formally align to the intent of RFC-0008\u2014shifting from a  CVSS-driven model to one grounded in real-world risk prioritization. \r\n\r\nSecond, we propose that FedRAMP launch a pilot program\u2014with  participation from Qualys and other industry leaders\u2014to: \r\n\r\n6 Vulnerability-Exploitability eXchange:  \r\n\r\nhttps://www.ntia.gov/sites/default/files/publications/vex\\_one-page\\_summary\\_0.pdf![][image7]  \r\n\u2022 Establish a minimum standard for risk operations management  platforms that incorporate risk based scoring and remediation across multiple dimensions of technology risk \u2013 cloud,  infrastructure, software; \r\n\r\n\u2022 Define reporting formats such as Open Security Controls  Assessment Language (OSCAL) and/or Open Cybersecurity  Schema Framework (OCSF); and \r\n\r\n\u2022 Define validation criteria for 3PAOs to assess both the technical  capabilities and procedural integration of these platforms. \r\n\r\nThis model builds directly on FedRAMP\u2019s current approach to  vulnerability scanning, where CSPs retain flexibility in tool selection  but are held accountable for capability. Just as 3PAOs validate that  RA-5 compliant scanning tools meet technical and operational  requirements, they should likewise validate risk-based platforms\u2014 such as Qualys TruRisk\u2014against clearly defined standards. Extending  this proven model to risk operations management is a logical and  necessary evolution. \r\n\r\n**Conclusion** \r\n\r\nQualys applauds the goals of FedRAMP 20x to make security  productive again by evolving how we ConMon. Approaches, such as  those in this response, allow security to reclaim their time, unlock  capacity, and drive Secure by Design. We must stop patching what  doesn\u2019t matter and focus on mitigating what does. Incorporating risk based prioritization allows us to expand ConMon scope without  creating the overhead that stops security efficiencies dead in their  tracks.

However, CSPs are already responsible for maintaining a POA&M based on  their continuous monitoring activities.  This standard appears to be additional reporting beyond what is already required via the POA&M process.\r\n\r\nFurther, these KSMs do not appear to align with the FedRAMP 20x KSIs.  \tThe FedRAMP PMO should consider re-visiting the POA&M process in the context of the Continuous Reporting Standard as it may be more efficient to add Key Security Metrics to the POA&M template. In addition, the FedRAMP PMO should consider aligning the KSMs with the 20x KSIs to ensure better awareness of gaps across Rev. 5 agency ATOs and 20x authorizations.\r\n2\tApplication of the Continuous Reporting Standard\tProviders MUST make Key Security Metrics available to agencies and FedRAMP in similar human-readable and compatible machine-readable formats. These formats SHOULD follow FedRAMP best practices and technical assistance to ensure maximum reusability.\tOur understanding is that the PMO will no longer maintain a centralized repository for a CSP's FedRAMP-related artifacts. Does this indicate that individuals from the PMO would need access to every CSP's documentation repository? If so, how would that be managed? \tThe FedRAMP PMO should clarifying expectations for making the Key Security Metrics available to agencies and FedRAMP.\r\n3\tApplication of the Continuous Reporting Standard\tProviders MUST make Key Security Metrics available to agencies and FedRAMP in similar human-readable and compatible machine-readable formats. These formats SHOULD follow FedRAMP best practices and technical assistance to ensure maximum reusability.\r\n\r\nProviders MUST update Key Security Metrics at least monthly.\r\n\r\nProviders MUST keep Key Security Metrics available to agencies and FedRAMP for 24 months after initial reporting.\tThe standard includes actions that CSPs are required to take.  Will these requirements be built into an existing FedRAMP control / parameter?\tThe FedRAMP PMO should consider clarifying how compliance with the standard would be enforced.\r\n4\tApplication of the Continuous Reporting Standard\tProviders SHOULD mitigate vulnerability risk as quickly as possible. Providers SHOULD adjust vulnerability severity based on documented mitigation.\tTraditionally, risk adjustments have required CSPs to submit deviation requests to their sponsoring / partnering agency.  Does this indicate that CSPs have the ability to lower the risk of a vulnerability with documented mitigations?\tThe FedRAMP PMO should clarify the process to mitigate vulnerability risk as part of the continuous monitoring process.\r\n5\tApplication of the Continuous Reporting Standard\tProviders, third-party assessment organizations, agencies, and FedRAMP SHOULD consider mitigated vulnerabilities at their mitigated risk rating. Providers MAY carry mitigated vulnerabilities beyond FedRAMP remediation windows for the original risk rating without penalty but MUST remediate such vulnerabilities once it is reasonable to do so.\r\n\tThe standard notes that CSPs should remediate vulnerabilities once it is reasonable to do so.  This does not set expectations for vulnerability remediation as it's not clear what would be considered reasonable.\tThe FedRAMP PMO should clarify the expectations for vulnerability remediation.\r\n6\tApplication of the Continuous Reporting Standard\tProviders SHOULD NOT include validated false positives in security reporting to agencies and FedRAMP. Providers MUST maintain documented evidence for determinations of false positives for the duration of their existence.\tThe standard does not clarify the validation process for false positives.  Do false positives need to be validated by a third-party? Where should the false positive documentation be stored if not required to be included in security reporting to agencies and FedRAMP. Further, the POA&M template has a column for \"False Positive\".  Will this column be removed if it's not required to report false positives to agencies and FedRAMP?\tThe FedRAMP PMO should consider clarifying expectations around the validation and tracking of false positives.\r\n7\tExceptions to the Continuous Monitoring Reporting Requirements\tProviders MAY be required to provide additional metrics beyond those identified above as a condition of a formal FedRAMP Corrective Action Plan or other agreements with federal agencies.\tThe Corrective Action Plan was an escalation process used by the JAB. It's not clear if a Corrective Action Plan would apply to a CSO with an agency ATO.\tThe FedRAMP PMO should consider clarifying the applicability of a Corrective Action Plan for agency authorizations.",

It seems the POA&M is being replaced, but not sure.<br>Continuous Reporting - 1. Unmitigated Vulnerabilities is the POA&M being replaced? When it says unmitigated items, this means non risk adjusted, correct? Why is the original detection date not included? Is a full list of unique CVEs listed with a tracking number (I assume this replaces the POA&M) 4. Component or services impacted replaces IP addresses, correct? Original FedRAMP remediation window end date is this based on the CVSS scoring and original detection date?<br>Is there a recommended method or form to communicate all of the requested information<br>It seems that FedRAMP is doing away with risk management deficiency triggers which is a refreshing change.<br>The direction is Providers SHOULD make Key Security Metrics available within their standard customer portals. However, this is not required. What say does the Agency have here?<br>Exceptions - FedRAMP Corrective Action Plan is mentioned?

Cloud Service Provider (CSP) | AWS Sentiment<br><br>We support the overarching goal of making continuous monitoring more consistent, reusable, and data-driven. However, we recommend refinements to several proposed reporting elements to ensure they align with existing FedRAMP mechanisms, avoid unnecessary operational burdens, and scale effectively across cloud service environments. Additionally, several elements require clearer definitions to avoid inconsistent interpretations and ensure practical implementation.<br><br><br><br>1\\. Clarity and Scope of Key Security Metrics Definitions<br><br>Key metrics\u2014such as Unmitigated Vulnerabilities require clearer definition. For example, it is unclear whether \u201cunmitigated vulnerabilities\u201d includes all vulnerabilities or only those past SLA. Do the legacy patching SLA\u2019s still exist if this reporting standard is approved? If the SLA\u2019s continue to apply, we recommend that an unmitigated vulnerability is defined as a security vulnerability that meets either of these conditions:<br><br>1\\. Has not been remediated within FedRAMP required SLAs<br>2\\. Lacks an approved Deviation Request that documents alternative or compensating<br>measures.<br><br>We also recommend that metrics are reported as percentage of unmitigated vulnerabilities per component type = (Number of unmitigated vulnerabilities for a component type / Total number of components of that type) \u00d7 100. Defining these elements clearly will reduce interpretive variability and support consistent implementation across providers.<br><br>2\\. Little applied security value from tracking mitigated vulnerabilities<br><br>Recommend not requiring tracking of mitigated vulnerabilities. The operational and resource costs of maintaining mitigated vulnerability records create an unsustainable burden that potentially diminishes overall security effectiveness:<br><br>Complex Documentation Requirements:<br>Each mitigated vulnerability requires tracking 10 distinct data points<br>This information must be maintained indefinitely unless its considered a KSI which must be kept for 24 months.<br>Monthly updates are required<br>Both human-readable and machine-readable formats must be maintained<br><br>Resource Allocation Impact:<br>Security teams must divide attention between current threats and historical documentation<br>Resources spent on maintaining historical records could be redirected to:<br>Active threat hunting<br>Real-time vulnerability management<br>Current security improvements<br>Proactive security measures<br><br>Diminishing Returns:<br>The value of historical mitigation data decreases over time<br>The 24-month retention requirement means maintaining potentially outdated information<br>Systems and threats evolve rapidly, making historical mitigation strategies less relevant<br><br>3\\. Monthly Monitoring Meetings<br><br>Recommend changing Application of the Continuous Reporting Standard, paragraph 4 to substitute \u201cmonthly monitoring meetings\u201d with \u201cdisseminating monthly reports\u201d. AWS has implemented a continuous monitoring report on an approximately monthly cadence since December. While formal monitoring meetings are not currently held, a draft version is shared with DoD stakeholders for review and then posted to CapLinked for broader federal access. FedRAMP should allow for a similar approach across CSPs by:<br><br>Defining a standardized monthly report format<br>Requiring reports to be made available at least one week in advance of oversight activities<br>Posting reports to a ConMon platform accessible to all federal customers.<br>It is also important to clarify whether these expectations introduce changes to existing SLAs, such as those for vulnerability or POA&M reporting.

Other       | General Support<br><br>The proposed approach to disclose unresolved high-risk vulnerabilities after missed remediation deadlines introduces valuable accountability and aims to protect federal data and missions. Transparency, when balanced correctly with operational security, is essential for the federal cloud ecosystem.<br><br>Recommendation: Model Disclosure After CISA\u2019s CDM Program<br><br>The FedRAMP program should consider aligning their vulnerability reporting framework with principles from CISA\u2019s Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program. CDM fosters shared situational awareness across federal agencies without compromising the operational security of cloud service providers (CSPs).<br><br>CDM\u2019s dashboards and scoring mechanisms allow agencies to prioritize remediation based on criticality and system context. A similar tiered disclosure or notification model could be implemented within FedRAMP. For example:<br>\u2022 Internal alerts could be prioritized for authorizing officials and agency security teams.<br>\u2022 Non-public interagency dashboards could highlight high-risk vulnerabilities and affected CSPs, without full public exposure.<br>\u2022 Public disclosures should only occur in cases where the vulnerability poses an immediate and substantial risk, and only after all other remediation and coordination channels are exhausted.<br><br>Security and Market Considerations<br><br>While timely vulnerability remediation is essential, public disclosure of unresolved vulnerabilities may unintentionally expose CSPs to adversarial exploitation. Many CSPs deliver complex, multi-tenant SaaS platforms where zero-day remediation may require more than a 30-day window to deploy the appropriate fix.<br><br>Therefore, the FedRAMP program should consider:<br>\u2022 Incorporating context-aware timelines for certain classes of vulnerabilities (e.g., supply chain, third-party dependencies).<br>\u2022 Establishing a formal appeals or exemption process for valid remediation delays that do not significantly raise operational risk.<br>\u2022 Ensuring any shared information is protected under appropriate federal information sharing agreements to prevent its misuse or weaponization.<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>FedRAMP\u2019s intent to improve system security through transparency is commendable. However, the implementation should build upon proven practices from CISA\u2019s CDM program and include risk-adjusted safeguards to avoid unintended harm to cloud providers or disruption to government operations.<br><br>Thank you again for the opportunity to contribute.

In the case of reporting, it could be beneficial to limit flexibility and create standardized reporting that can be more easily automated and consumed. Maintaining a mandatory FedRAMP template for the Continuous Monitoring deliverables provides the standard format and minimum reporting requirements across all providers. Flexibility in reporting may result in agencies needing to analyze various report formats or CSOs being required to provide customized formats to individual clients.<br><br>\\- Recommend updating the current POA&M template and/or One-Pager template to align with new standard and change bullet #1 of Application of Continuous Reporting Standard section to state providers MUST use standard template to enforce consistency across FedRAMP program.<br><br>\\- Bullet #1 of Application of Continuous Reporting Standard section states providers MUST make metrics available in human-readable and machine-readable formats. Please provide clarification on when machine-readable formats beyond CSV files will be required to meet standards.<br><br>\\- Please identify the acceptable machine-readable formats as part of the standard to create consistency across all CSOs allowing both providers and consumers to more easily implement automation of processes throughout application portfolios. If included in FedRAMP best practices and technical assistance will fall under the SHOULD statement.<br><br>\\- Recommend standardizing reporting cadence in bullet #2 of Application of Continuous Reporting Standard section to monthly vice \u201cat-least monthly\u201d. This flexibility will create various requirements/expectations from agencies<br><br>\\- Recommend changing bullet #5 of Application of Continuous Reporting Standard section to a MUST statement. This is a reasonable requirement that provides visibility of current risk profile to agencies.<br><br>Tracking and reporting mitigated vulnerabilities at the adjusted risk rating is a step in the right direction. This allows for a single risk rating to be used in a single column vice possibility of missing adjusted rating since that requires scrolling across a complex spreadsheet.<br><br>\\- Please specify if mitigated vulnerability listing only applies to vulnerabilities with a risk adjusted deviation request previously identified in the unmitigated list vice vulnerabilities corrected during routine patching or corrected during standard timeframe (30, 90, 180 days)<br><br>\\- Please specify if mitigated vulnerabilities are intended to be a running list and for how long they should be reported<br><br>The unmitigated vulnerabilities reporting standard identifies reasonable and appropriate metrics to be included.<br><br>\\- Please specify if this list includes all unmitigated vulnerabilities or only those that are past due or include a deviation request. Limiting to past due and deviation request vulnerabilities aligns with current POA&M guidance and provides a more concise view of risk posture. Including vulnerabilities that will be corrected as part of normal patching schedule does not add value to the report.<br><br>\\- Recommend considering ways to reduce reporting requirements. Several widely used industry products no longer prioritize correction of moderate or low findings due to cost and time constraints. Additionally, FedRAMP does not have a trigger associated with low findings. Recommend eliminating requirement to report and mitigate low findings or establishing a new minimum CVSS score that constitutes a reportable finding. This would reduce effort and cost for both CSP and agencies.<br><br>\\- Recommend ability for CSPs to suspend continuous monitoring activities while remaining in an authorized status if not actively hosting a client. The CSPs being authorized via pilot programs may experience a significant period of time before onboarding a new client. Currently authorized CSPs may also have periods between contracted agencies. Continuous monitoring during those periods creates significant costs to CSPs and removal from marketplace reduces ability for agencies to rapidly leverage products.<br><br>Regarding overall scan coverage and detailed component scan coverage, the current FedRAMP inventory report template is intended to provide a comprehensive list of all components in environment along with an indication of whether the specific device has been scanned for the current monthly report. Recommend updating the current inventory template to include new standard requirements. If this or other requirements are intended only for automated machine-readable reports, please specify since current Rev 5 authorizations do not have requirement for automated testing. |                                                                                                                  |\r\n",
