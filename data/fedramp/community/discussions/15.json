      "body": "IMO publishing compliance metrics publicly introduces several risks and challenges that could undermine the intended goals of AO risk-based decision-making as well as zero trust architecture:\r\n\r\nThe intent of KSIs and automation is to provide a technical means for AOs to risk tolerance associated cloud service offering risks. In a risk-based model, impact is constant, but public visibility can increase the likelihood of exploitation, potentially altering risk decisions that may have been acceptable in a more controlled context.\r\n\r\nPublic exposure of compliance metrics may discourage CSPs from sharing real-time or near real-time information, especially when addressing short-term or low-risk non-conformities that are actively being remediated. Fear of reputational damage may delay communication, reducing the value of timely and transparent updates.\r\n\r\nPublicly disclosing detailed compliance status tied to KSIs may be counterproductive in a zero trust model, where minimizing exposure and limiting implicit trust is important. Broadcasting this data publicly could offer unnecessary insight to threat actors.\r\n\r\nOverall, while transparency is important, publishing compliance metrics publicly, especially in raw or real-time form, can introduce new risks, undermine trust frameworks like zero trust, and ultimately hinder the effectiveness of informed, risk-based decisions by the AOs.",

          "body": "Thanks @JustinPadilla-Kratos for being brave enough to kick off this conversation. You raise really good points. My thoughts below are not intended to discount the concerns you are raising. I'm interested in your response as well as feedback from other community members.\r\n\r\nI think I can sum up your concerns into two categories:\r\n1. Adversaries might be able to use the information we are posting to attack us, and\r\n2. Companies may have concerns about posting data, even if there is no benefit to an attacker, for other reasons\r\n\r\n**Adversaries might be able to use the information we are posting to attack us**\r\nWhile I agree this is and should be a concern, I think it is somewhat OBE because in most cases we should assume our adversaries already have this information. IMHO the idea that a vulnerability is obscure and my adversaries may not find it or know about it is a very dangerous position. Especially in the government where our adversaries are often nation-state level actors. \r\n\r\n**Companies may have concerns about posting data regardless of any benefit to an attacker**\r\nI think you raise a really important issue here. Not only might a company be concerned for their reputation but may also have legal or regulatory issues that make publicly disclosing vulnerabilities infeasible. Although in an ideal world everyone would want to publish real time data publically to show how awesome they are \ud83d\ude04. I'd like to hear from people about ways to mitigate this. For example, what about a solution where monthly data showing the past 30 days is published publicly and real time or more frequent data is restricted?\r\n\r\nOne last point, we should also consider the potential benefits public disclosures could create. Just a few possible examples include:\r\n1. Agencies can easily compare multiple vendor's security to decide which product(s) best match their risk tolerance for a project\r\n2. The reputational risk we are discussing might provide leverage for security teams to get the support and resources they need\r\n3. Publically available data streamlines the necessary data collection when major security events like zero-day vulnerabilities occur.  \r\n\r\nI'm really interested to hear from the community here about these and other potential benefits as well as concerns and challenges.\r\n",

IT's misuse of CUI for sure. \r\n Also, you'd get dinged pretty hard from FedRAMP in the pre-20x days if you did this.   Disclosing vulnerability data was a huge no-no and you would not receive FedRAMP approval until this was fixed.  In fact, you weren't even allowed to share SSPs with non-government customers.  (Side note: I did get to sit on a meeting between DHS and the NYPD as they argued over this.  It was like one of those turf wars from TV cop shows.  It got resolved amiably).\r\n\r\nTo your point, though:\r\n> Adversaries might be able to use the information we are posting to attack us\r\n> While I agree this is and should be a concern, I think it is somewhat OBE because in most cases we should assume our adversaries already have this information.

          "body": "I agree with the hesitations described above in this thread. Just because an adversary can find out security configurations doesn't mean CSPs should make it easier for them. Of course a nation-state level actor can uncover much of this information but the cost of time and resources to acquire that information is a deterrent to threat activity. Additionally, if adversaries could publicly access data for CSPs they could keep a repository of which CSPs use specific tools or configurations and when a zero day for those tools/configurations is available know who to exploit. Providing some abstraction or generality to the data (just overall metrics without specific implementations) would help reduce that risk but then would make the data less useful for agencies and others looking to perform a risk assessment of the CSP. \r\n\r\nIn terms of a solution that balances transparency with \"least privilege\" and privacy I could see:\r\n1) a web based platform where agencies or companies could request access to security data and be approved by the CSP (similar to [CISA's Repository for Software Attestations and Artifacts](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-software-development-attestation-form)) \r\n2) a delay to publish security data so that gaps can be addressed before the information is public \r\n3) publicly available 3PAO report without technical specifics (agencies/customers would need to trust the 3PAO to assess accurately and the CSP would need to trust the 3PAO to not share technical specifics)\r\n\r\nTo directly answer the original question of **What are the risks and challenges you are facing when asked to publish your compliance metrics publicly?** \u2014 a major concern is the potential perception by others (customers, agencies, etc) that we are insecure or not following best practices if our security data is available publicly without any access control.\r\n\r\n-- Isaac Teuscher (Paramify)",

The ability for the public to contribute is most effective when there is publicly available information for the public to review and thereby contribute to the security of the system by disclosing issues to the owner of the information. Hiding information prevents the public from contributing.\r\n\r\nA system with a responsibly but publicly published security architecture with a supporting vulnerability disclosure policy and an effective program for encouraging and handling disclosures will be _more secure_ and _less likely to be compromised_ than the same system with the same policy that hides its security architecture because the public is given much more ability to contribute.

Right now it's super broad - that NIST SP 800-53 language about \"information describing characteristics of data\" covers practically everything.\r\n\r\nHere's where we keep hitting roadblocks - we get dinged anytime FedRAMP \"metadata\" touches a non-authorized system, but some of this stuff is pretty benign.\r\n\r\nA real example from our world: We've kept our AWS accounts completely split (commercial vs FedRAMP) because we're worried about metadata leakage - even just internal IPs, stack names, basic account identifiers because some of the names could be tied to the type of data \"RecordingsService\" as an example. But this separation means we can't use AWS Organizations to manage security configs centrally. So when new accounts get created, we don't have automatic security controls applied by AWS and we have to implement it all through IaC. Kind of feels like we're creating bigger security gaps while trying to follow the metadata rules.\r\n\r\nThose dashboard requirements (no login/no NDA) are also tricky. Seems like we're caught between \"share more openly!\" and \"keep all metadata locked down in authorized systems only!\"\r\n\r\nNot trying to be difficult, just wondering if there's a way to get more practical guidance. Maybe all metadata isn't equal?
