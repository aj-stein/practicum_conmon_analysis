          "body": "1. The biggest one on my mind at the moment is creating a real-time web of trust w/ cryptographic validation. In six months, a CSP will be leveraging validation capabilities from their IaaS/PaaS, integrated with their GRC automation tool, supplemented by maybe a couple additional third-party cybersecurity tools, and maybe leveraging three FedRAMP authorized external services. We need a way for the CSP to present their validated configuration and usage of all of those systems with proof they haven't tampered with any of it and that it's accurate against their inventory and information flows. \ud83e\udd14 \r\n\r\n2. Moving away from yearly point in time towards anything approaching actual continuous monitoring is the most valuable security outcome. Value can be measured in a lot of other ways too. ;)\r\n\r\n3. Yes, in general. The federal stakeholder situation is still changing at an unprecedented rate. CIOs, CISOs, and senior security folks all across gov are changing over. That's why we're focused on CSPs and delivery right now.\r\n\r\nThe significant concern we've heard from extremely conservative agencies is that they do not ever intend to trust any business to make decisions without those decisions being approved by the agency. It's a line in the sand that we can't engage with, as FedRAMP has been explicitly directed to deliver an approach that allows commercial services to make changes without advance permission from the agency. \r\n",
