# Post

In the spirit of FedRAMP 20x I’m going to keep this post as brief and direct as possible.

**Cloud Service Provider**: KMI Learning (https://www.kmilearning.com)
**Cloud Service Offering**: KMI LMS – A web-based Learning Management System
**Hosting Platform**: AWS Commercial Region (greenfield deployment specific for 20x pilot) 
**3PAO**: TBD to align with 20x aggressive timeline (Coalfire for previous assessments)
**Compliance Status**: FedRAMP authorized, technology partner for Package ID FR2113157410

**Link to Pilot Submission**: https://github.com/KMI-Learning/FedRAMP-20x-Pilot

We are approaching this project with a ‘blank-page’ mindset, where we create entirely new ways to automate our audit, evidence, and validation processes. Our goal is to meet the FedRAMP 20x vision of a 100% machine-verifiable, continuously auditable authorization, without the use of legacy audit techniques like screenshots or static documentation review.

Have to say on initial thinking, this is closest to my quick-and-dirty imagined solution without a premade tool for everything. Would love to see FedRAMP's feedback here.
