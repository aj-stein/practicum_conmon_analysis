I ask this, because historically in the pre-20x world, where packages had essentially three levels of review (or more), even the 3PAO validation was often questioned. Obviously, it is the AO's or FedRAMP's prerogative to review and perform a deep dive into the package, but I think the thought is to have a lighter touch review than in the past, hence the much faster package reviews happening today.\r\n>\r\n>So I think it's important to understand at what point an auditor's evaluation is deemed acceptable. And yes, we have R311 and A2LA for FedRAMP 3PAOs, but I think determing the level of trust we are going to grant credence to the opinion of an auditor from another framework is a valuable exercise. Just like we offer presumption of adequacy for an ATO to be reused, should we have some way to presume adequacy and trust for non-FedRAMP auditors? This would prevent the re-evaluation of a SOC2 report by an A2LA accredited FedRAMP 3PAO. Which is mostly rework, more money, and more time, and not necessarily an improvement in the overall security posture of the CSO.\r\n>\r\n>Or is this a rabbithole where we start having AICPA authorized SOC 2 assessors being required to follow R311 (or a subset thereof?) or certain KSIs require less rigor (e.g. a SOC 2 auditor's opinion on training vs SOC 2 auditor's opinion on encryption)?\r\n\r\nIf we are not willing to accept the opinion of an AICPA accredited auditor (probably with some caveats, see below) of a SOC 2, SOC 2 becomes a non-starter, since it would require an A2LA accredited 3PAO to recheck/redo things, which negates most of the point.  This holds for ANY and ALL other frameworks, including ISO, HITRUST, etc.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I don't agree with  I think SOC 2 has value, but we may need *formal and defined* requirements or circumstances that would allow a SOC 2 opinion to be deemed acceptable and leveraged.  So either accept it at face value, or have some mechanism by which we 'certify' the auditor (e.g. parts of R311).  \r\n\r\n",

Makes sense, I misread that at first glance.\r\n\r\n> Even if all we achieve is that a business with a SOC 2 is able to feel a bit more confident about starting on FedRAMP _and considers doing it where they wouldn't before_, that's a win at scale. \r\n\r\nJust a few thoughts as I think this through:\r\na- if all we are trying to do is boost confidence, that's not SOC 2 specific.  That could be ANY framework, or generically 'reasonably mature security posture.'  We're not actually *applying an existing framework* though.  And that's ok, but wanted to be clear.\r\nb- from my experience, the main barriers to FedRAMP are less about confidence security wise, and more about is there a sufficient goverment/government adjacent market to justify the effort, and can we get an agency sponsor (which this pilot solves).  If the market is there, then people tend to do the analysis on what is necessary to get FedRAMP authorized, and then proceed.  Some gamble on a market that never materializes (hence the old RARs that sit on the marketplace for a few years and then drop off).  The barrier to entry is more the effort, time, and price necessary to make a FedRAMP compliant system (as opposed to a generically secure system which most people already strive for).\r\nc- I guess what I'm saying is that a SOC 2 is a generically secure system, as opposed to a FedRAMP compliant system.  But it's not entirely clear if it's intended as a stepping stone to FedRAMP.  I actually think it could be, but to do so, it would be helpful if we make that bridge explicit.  I'd rather pay a 3PAO for a gap analysis and/or KSI assessment right off the bat.  The SOC 2 doesn't offer much concrete value to me unless it\u2019s given some level of formal credit; otherwise it feels more like a vague gut check.  And that's true of any other framework.\r\n\r\n>If someone with a SOC 2 might have a head start where they're likely to meet say 5 KSIs because they made changes to their processes for SOC 2 and now just need to tweak some docs and have a FedRAMP 3PAO review it, that's a win at scale.\r\n\r\nOk, so the goal here is 'hey, by doing a SOC 2, you are probably close to a few KSIs.'  That's fair, and I think valuable.  The follow up exercise is probably identifying which KSIs are close given a general SOC 2, and then developing a mechanism to self identify any delta.   \r\n \r\n> Nobody is trying to move FedRAMP to a world where someone with an external certification will magically receive FedRAMP authorization. We're just trying to make it easier for companies to use their existing investments to make progress instead of starting from scratch. That's why we're focusing on the most common existing investments companies have made that don't traditionally align with FedRAMP first.\r\n\r\nI'm just still trying to clarify what the tangible value is in focusing on SOC 2 specifically, versus other frameworks.  I understand the confidence and general having a mature security posture.  I'm trying to find a way (if one exists) to show a concrete, useful, actionable benefit from having a SOC 2 as a stepping stone to full FedRAMP.\r\n\r\nAlso, please don't take this as being argumentative;  there's obviously a reason we have a dedicated workgroup for 'applying existing frameworks' and that the pilot has a SOC 2.  I guess I interpreted the intent to 'give credit' (even if partial) to other frameworks and it sounds like that's not the case.  Maybe I'm missing something.  For what it's worth, I'm actually a proponent for 'giving some credit' to other frameworks.  What, and how, and how much are different discussions, and I think worth having.\r\n",

Repurposing the use of a RAR at the FedRAMP level for... something akin to KSIs.  \r\n\r\nI've also noticed that the GovRAMP RAR has migrated away from the old FedRAMP RAR narrative format and into more of a mini-SRTM with some other tabs (and kudos for that).  \r\n\r\nSide question for anyone who may know.  Does DoD still require a DoD RAR?  They used it mostly as an architecture overview before proceeding to a full SAR.\r\n",

          "body": "Folks - just went through the 107 SKIs, which align to NIST / FedRAMP Low Base Line. Our company has just completed both a FedRAMP  Moderate RAR as well as the DoD FedRAMP Moderate Equivalency, latest versions both. I determined to pull forward the evidence / artifacts used to demonstrate compliance to the 326 Controls and 698 objectives from the MBL. Interesting is that your SKI are asking for a lot of evidence that is in a Policy / Procedure --- what gives with placing that into Machine Readable and  \"on-demand\"? I have created a single, rather verbose, document containing all the L Baseline artifacts we collected as part of our Moderate journey and am asking the Technical teams to identify what % can logically be pulled into a Machine Readable format that could be drawn upon on request from FedRAMP PMO. I have to tell you, from the SKI, you guys may want to think on how we present all Domain 6 / 7 / 8, and parts of  some of the others in a Machine Readable format. I do not think this is at all doable --- I mean, maybe list them out in a spreadsheet? Dunno... Anyway, the short runway you have asked to submit the entirety of the SKI in Machine Readable -- not based in reality. Cheers",

      "body": "@pete-gov \r\nWe are trying to determine LoE for the Phase One Pilot. We are almost done with both our RAR and DoD's FedRAMP Moderate Equivalency. DoD's FedRAMP Equivalency requires the exact same SAR and full compliance with the 325 800-53 controls as FedRAMP's Moderate Base Line (this is why DoD named it FedRAMP Moderate Equivalency). DoD's FedRAMP Moderate Equivalency mandate also requires assessment by a FedRAMP approved 3PAO. Would this Body of Evidence suffice for a Phase One Pilot submission or do we have to spend time mapping these things the Key Security Indicators. That's a lot of work for someone who has just paid a 3PAO for both FedRAMP Ready and DoD's FedRAMP Moderate Equivalency. ",
