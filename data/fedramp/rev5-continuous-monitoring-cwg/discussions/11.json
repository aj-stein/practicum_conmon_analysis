          "body": "For example, the existing SCR process needs to change. Formerly JAB systems are required to do a SAR for every SCR which is not consistent with the Agency authorizations, which allow for assessing the SCRs at the annual. This inequality needs to be remedied, along with the amount of money CSPs spend on the SCR process. The Modernization Memo talked about giving the agency a \"heads up\" on changes - we should go towards this model and have the CSP's internal testing process assessed by the 3PAO at the annual rather than testing each change. Allows CSPs to go to market quicker and supports revenue. We never heard as a FR community what happened to the SCR working groups that were supposed to simplify this process.",

The authorizations issued to our IaaS by the agencies are typically granted for applications running on the IaaS, rather than for the IaaS itself. The authorizing agencies have no interest in any SCR involving the IaaS, and the SCRs are not aligned with the agency's interest. I agree with @bajosephs that the changes should be tested by the CSP, go live and added to the ConMon, and assessed during the AA. ",

We'll be focused throughout this on setting a standard that lowers the burden for agencies and CSPs to review continuous monitoring reports without FedRAMP in the middle.",
