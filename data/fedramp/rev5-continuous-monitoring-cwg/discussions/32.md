# Post

Hey all! I wanted to bring up a question regarding container security requirements.

With regards to pipelines - do the FedRAMP products have to have a separate pipeline or do CSPs just need to have a completely separate container registry for the product(s) they are getting assessed and ATO'd?

With the way I read the last requirements doc it sounds like CSPs just need a separate repository (makes sense) and not a separate pipeline for the product.

Thanks all!

I would not imagine a separate pipeline for a baseline that is used globally. Especially when the containers are managed in a Dev environment as part of your SDLC. I'd be interested to hear the PMO's POV on your question.

Where I get my images from does not require FedRAMP ATO unless that is a cloud service that has direct connections into the boundary, which I would not recommend. All images require FIPS compliance with certificates that are listed in the CVMP site for both DaR and DiT. I deployed Solo Gloo Mesh for DiT for Node to Node communications in EKS. SDLC is not required to have a separated ATO that I have ever seen and I will be shocked at a different answers there. As long as you are watching for EOL, have plans and workflows to upgrade/updates, monitoring/scanning for CVEs, and tracking on the POA&M. My SLDC workflows have no customer data or metadata involved. All configurations and testing are applied in my staging zone within the boundary.
