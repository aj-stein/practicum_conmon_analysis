Hi all. I'm Melissa Prager, the Microsoft Azure FedRAMP Compliance Continuous Monitoring lead, and also current lead for the Cloud Service Providers Advisory Board's ConMon practitioners committee. We have a lot of passion for iterating on FedRAMP requirements so that we can make it easy for agencies to understand a CSP's security posture.

Hello all, my name is David Bryant and I am the Security Compliance Manager (CISM, CRISC, CISA) at Lastwall. I manage DoD and FedRAMP compliance requirements. I look forward to learning and working with everyone to help streamline FedRAMP authorization process. My hope is to have a more simplified FedRAMP authorization process (framework) with greater use of automation and streamline processes to obtain and maintain FedRAMP compliance. In addition, have this new framework have the ability to seamlessly integrate into a GRC tool.

Hello All,

This is a group account where all of the Telos Solutions Architects have access. There are a few of us that will be participating.

I am Stephanie Lacy, from [Telos](https://www.telos.com/), and the wearer of many hats.  I work as a solutions architect, creating and establishing technical requirements, the current ISSO of our CSO package, have worked to support agencies with assessments and determining requirements, have also worked with NIST and FedRAMP on the evolution of OSCAL, and work with the team on refining the Xacta FedRAMP Rev 5 template.  

Brad is the Solutions architect that had lead our technical integration with OSCAL, including creating a 'rosetta stone' like tool for translating OSCAL into other formats, and visa versa. He also developed many of the workflows in our template that support the Rev 5 Process.  

Amanda is the Solutions Architect that developed a solution to ingest hard copies of the FedRAMP provided templates into Xacta, and has working knowledge of the specific complexities and challenges that our customers are facing, as she interfaces with them regularly.  

Micah is the Solutions Architect that has developed automation elements within our package, creating solutions that support our ConMon process to free up resources for critical work, instead of paper creation.  This includes automated testing of controls, Scanner integration for POAM creation, and initial analysis of findings.

Our bench and focus is currently on FedRAMP process refinement, and are excited to support the evolution of FedRAMP

Hi all! My name is Courtney Manning, and I'm the Director of [AI Imperative 2030](https://ai.americansecurityproject.org/) at the American Security Project. 

As a nonprofit research institute, we work to educate and inform policymakers and the public about the near-term national security threats posed by adversary exploitation of artificial intelligence. As cyber attacks on U.S. cloud systems become more sophisticated and pervasive, strong federal cyber security standards and practices are more important than ever. To remain competitive on the global stage, it's also essential to have an efficient process that promotes competition and avoids unnecessary burdens on our private sector innovators. Looking forward to seeing everyone's ideas on how to thread this needle and sharing these findings with our legislators.

Cheers.  My name is Jon Cottrell, recently started my own Business / IT consulting business at [BetterStitch](https://www.linkedin.com/company/betterstitch).  My background is mostly in the healthcare industry, but I've nibbled around the edges of FedRAMP and StateRAMP to help organizations think through the journey of hopping from commercial to federal business.

Larry Hughes (VP of R&D) from Cloud Security Alliance (CSA). CSA works with some 15,000 global volunteers to define and raise awareness of best practices for cloud security. We believe that our STAR program (Security Trust Assurance and Risk) and Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM), which have played an important role in the cloud security ecosystem since 2013, can play an important role in FedRAMP 20x.

>Hi everyone!
I'm Sai Sravan Cherukuri, a DevSecOps & FinOps Leader, AI Maturity Model Innovator, and CMMC Strategist, currently serving as a DevSecOps Technical Advisor and Program Manager at the IRS.

With over 20 years of experience in IT modernization, I specialize in secure software delivery, enterprise automation, and compliance enablement across large-scale federal programs. I'm particularly passionate about integrating emerging technologies—like AI and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)—with governance frameworks like FedRAMP and CMMC to drive continuous improvement, efficiency, and resilience in federal systems.

I am excited to be part of this community and eager to engage in meaningful discussions around FedRAMP Rev 5 and Continuous Monitoring!
Warm regards,
Sai Sravan Cherukuri
