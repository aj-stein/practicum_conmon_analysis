I work as a solutions architect, creating and establishing technical requirements, the current ISSO of our CSO package, have worked to support agencies with assessments and determining requirements, have also worked with NIST and FedRAMP on the evolution of OSCAL, and work with the team on refining the Xacta FedRAMP Rev 5 template.  \r\n\r\nBrad is the Solutions architect that had lead our technical integration with OSCAL, including creating a 'rosetta stone' like tool for translating OSCAL into other formats, and visa versa. He also developed many of the workflows in our template that support the Rev 5 Process.  \r\n\r\nAmanda is the Solutions Architect that developed a solution to ingest hard copies of the FedRAMP provided templates into Xacta, and has working knowledge of the specific complexities and challenges that our customers are facing, as she interfaces with them regularly.  \r\n\r\nMicah is the Solutions Architect that has developed automation elements within our package, creating solutions that support our ConMon process to free up resources for critical work, instead of paper creation.  This includes automated testing of controls, Scanner integration for POAM creation, and initial analysis of findings.\r\n\r\nOur bench and focus is currently on FedRAMP process refinement, and are excited to support the evolution of FedRAMP\r\n\r\n",
