  "body": "Team,\r\n\r\nWhile we do anticipate some changes to be made to the draft SCN guidance as part of the public comment process, we do not anticipate a change of high level intent.  \r\n\r\nWith that in mind the FedRAMP team is looking into what potential machine readable SCNs or an automated SCN process solutions would look like.  \r\n\r\nDo CSPs have tools and processes in place that they leverage with other partners for similar processes?  Are there best practices that exist in rolling this out? \r\n\r\n",
