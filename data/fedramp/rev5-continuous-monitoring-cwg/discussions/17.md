Securing systems starts with a complete inventory. As a CSP, one of your first and most fundamental challenges is to find a tool that can produce a complete inventory in the format required by the FedRAMP Inventory Template. Depending on what cloud provider you use and what CMDB solution you may have, most CSPs end up spending significant time and money developing custom scripts or doing manual Excel work monthly.

The idea in this thread is to discuss how best to create a basic open-source minimum viable product that:

- Pulls inventory from the major cloud providers using their native APIs
- Includes inventory for all of the following inventory object types that are in boundary:
  - Virtual machines (EC2)
  - Container images from the native cloud-platform container registry and commonly used registries
  - Databases that are available from cloud inventory
- Is architected to be easily extensible - This will allow CSPs to develop their own custom adapters for additional inventory sources (e.g. common CMDB solutions, SQL query) and inventory object types (e.g. installed databases) with minimal effort
- Allows for output in CSV and OSCAL JSON (SSP) using the same attributes as defined in the [FedRAMP Integrated Inventory 
- Supports an inventory tagging strategy for attributes not available from cloud providers natively but that are needed by FedRAMP PMO, 3PAO and Agencies to meet control requirements and for assessments
- Helps support simple future automated or semi-automated methods of ensuring alignment between the inventory, boundary diagram and SSP for easier and quicker assessments
- Backlog feature - Tracks inventory changes over time and keeps configurable length of change history
- Backlog feature - Monitors cloud provider change logs to detect changes to inventory and provides alerting (CM-8(3)) 


Although there is a lot more required for reporting besides cloud inventory, I am thinking this is a good place to start to see if there is sufficient community interest. The idea with this approach is to put together the basic building blocks for cloud inventory with a very simple feature set. Of course, dedicated software companies could do a lot more, but for the many small to medium businesses out there pursuing FedRAMP it would give them a free place to get started.

To get started:

- We could potentially start with a collection of inventory scripts from the community.  For example, @austinsonger has made FedRAMP scripts available at https://github.com/Elevated-Standards  .   Other CSPs may be willing to contribute code.
- We ideally need people that can dedicate time to this effort .   It would be especially helpful if the hyperscalers could participate since it is there inventory that is needed.   AWS for example contributed https://github.com/aws-samples/fedramp-integrated-inventory-workbook but it has not been updated in awhile.
- We could potentially collaborate with the CNCF Compliance Working Group (tx @sunstonesecure-robert for the idea ) since they are on similar track but more broadly across compliance programs focusing on Cloud Native environments.  See https://tag-security.cncf.io/community/working-groups/compliance/

If we are discussing inventory, I think a good starting point would be to decide what the standards are for what is Inventory vs what is a component.  For instance, where would a security group fall?  Should that be a component, like a service, and we list the PPSM for each security group, and then link that component to the inventory.  Right now the legacy SSP Appendix M defines inventory as Hardware (can be virtual), software and DB's.  This is usually interpreted as virtual machines, containers, any software installed on these hosts, and any databases.  There are various other services that may also need to be considered inventory.  

The other side of that inventory story, is organizations that have millions of inventory items (think large CSP's).  How should they report on inventory?  Are they only owning the images that they provide downstream, or do they also have to report on deviations within other boundaries where they are being leveraged.  

FedRAMP, if there is explicit guidance, this would be a great starting point.  The OSCAL SSP model provides comprehensive, programmatic features for reporting on inventory, and the FedRAMP Automation team has defined additional properties that communicate the elements that are included in the legacy documentation.   But with the added features of being able to logically link to other components (like cryptographic mechanisms, and services for PPSM).  
https://automate.fedramp.gov/documentation/ssp/4-ssp-template-to-oscal-mapping/

This already provides the roadmap and guidance on what programmatically should be submitted. For continuous submission, defining the requirements for what to update and what to provide would be next.  
Using the structure, provided, CSPs should be able to deliver in-time inventory changes in OSCAL format for maintenance.  

The next question would be, how often should CSPs submit, if continuous and when changes occur, what is the notification process look like?  

### User Stories for consideration:
I am a CSP that needs a portal to automate the submission of my inventory and POA&Ms in a continuous basis to report on changes to the risk landscape of my CSO.  

I am an AO that needs to be alerted when the changes to the CSP's inventory and risks change (need definition on what the Key Security Indicators (KSI) would be for notification). So that I can coordinate with them on an action plan, or roll back changes to get to a more secure state (Need to talk about CCB, and incorporating CCB at agency level of SIA is critical (it is)).   I need to be able to see the new risks in an easy to take action on system, that allows me to also coordinate with PMO and CSP as needed.  

I am the PMO, who needs to be alerted when a CSO package is updated, and measure it against the acceptable risks of the Federal Government and notify the downstream consumers of the change in the risk landscape, so that these other systems can deploy compensating controls, and/or address the inherited risks.

@Telos-sa we discussed the need on the CNCF WG about maybe more than a System Security Plan - but a System Security Operational Posture/Snapshot (clearly we are not marketing savvy ;)

I think your user stories fit well into that. A Plan is forward looking and reflects aspirations.  Alerts/changes is part of an operational modality. (And we added a 3rd category - forensics and historical review.)

We may need to define a nomenclature for "inventory" that is distinct for each user story/modalities.

- Inventory (for Planning)
- Snapshot (for Operating/ConMon)
- Log/Ledger (for History)

I think we can start simply with the definition in the [FedRAMP Integrated Inventory Workbook Template](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/SSP-Appendix-M-Integrated-Inventory-Workbook-Template.xlsx) .   That template requires the following categories of inventory:

- OS/Infrastructure (aka Compute) - This would be your virtual machines (aka EC2)
- Containers - This would be the base images for containers you have deployed in-boundary

The template also asks for an inventory of Software.   However, this will be a challenging and potentially complex category, so I would suggest a phased approach where we start simply with the first two, and then later expand the feature set.    

My hope is that we can get assistance from either the major cloud providers or from software vendors for more advanced features that would require large teams to develop and maintain.   I think there is a lot of value for small to medium business in a small starter open source solution that they could use to get started quickly with their FedRAMP authorization preparation.

I think container images are sufficiently well defined and discrete:  images in repository that could be deployed into production.  We have to inventory and scan those now.  That's straightforward because the number of actual instantiated containers does not matter, just the canonical list of images.

I think if there's a way to do something similar with the compute instances.  And in theory, there could.  What's the underlying 'base image' for a given VM?  Let me walk through this (not all steps below are necessarily always used)
Step 0 Starts with an AMI, OS image, or whatever
Step 1 Hardening to STIG or whatever
Step 2 Customized to CSP standard (monitoring agents, log forwarders, whatever)
Step 3 Customized for its unique function in the environment (e.g. web front end, etc)  (aka the final customization)

At what point should we deem this a 'baseline?'  I've seen all of the above deemed a baseline.  (or alternatively, the scripts applied in subsequent steps being considered the baseline).  

I like the idea of treating Step 3 as the definitive 'unique inventory item' (and ultimately the vuln scan target).  It loops back to the golden image mentioned elsewhere, and aligns with the unique container image mindset.

Agreed @jsantore-cgc , generally I have seen 3PAOs and FedRAMP accept that a base container image and base VM image for scale sets to be acceptable for inventory as long as you can prove that an exact image is made and it is immutable.  Most container tech and auto scale solutions can be configured this way.   

This approach makes inventory much easier in highly elastic environments where scales sets and container clusters scale up and down rapidly. 

I would say to simplify that the "Container" category should also include base images for scale sets and the  chosen identifier being something unique to the base image

@jsantore-cgc we may be saying the same thing, but as I have seen this cause confusion in the past I'd like to clarify: I think that we need to be careful about limiting to `images in repository` as I have seen that get interpreted to mean that `only the images hosted in the system's repository are to be scanned` and to do so would leave some blind spots. To get a full picture of the container image usage in the environment I believe the question needs to be `what images can run, regardless of where they came from?`. For example: if using EKS, public images such as https://gallery.ecr.aws/eks/amazon-k8s-cni may be used. Scanning only the images in the system repository would miss anything running which is sourced from outside the repository (intentionally or unintentionally). Based on my experience I believe that the best way to proceed is to `scan any image which _could_ run with the current configuration`.  Makes scanner config a bit more complex. but is a solvable problem.

However, there are some additional wrinkles: when scanning an image, we are going to be scanning the version(s)  (denoted by image tags) which could run in the environment (I have observed cases where multiple versions of the same image were allowed to run concurrently within a single system). Fine and well, but what do we track vulnerability aging against? The container image sans version tag (since that is the baseline functional entity) or the container image with the version tag, since that is what is actually running for however long or short a time? 

There are advantages and disadvantages to each approach, but the most defensible approach we have thus far found and established with FedRAMP is to inventory and track against the container image sans version tag, since that persists, while scanning the deployable version(s) of the container image. 

When it comes to resources such as VMs. I struggle with the concept of a "baseline", as the definition has always appeared to me to be quite subjective and not all that useful in actual practice (Its more useful for ephemeral VMs than long-lived ones, but even ephemeral VMs will typically have some level of configuration done post launch, and that configuration can introduce some changes we'd very much care about from a compliance and security perspective). What matters more in my experience is the deployed configuration, and the most reliable way to assess risk is to scan what is actually there, not what we _think should be there_. If all is working as it should then the venn diagram of what is there and what we _think_ should be there is a perfect circle, but I have and continue to see many cases where there is  some level of divergence. Detecting and addressing that divergence is a core ConMon function as I see it, so I'd be hesitant to adopt any approach which makes it more difficult to detect and address such divergences.

hey @atfurman ,  you are right there are many nuances.  I think for a MVP implementation we should focus on supporting inventory from the native cloud-container registries for the major cloud providers as a starting point.   The CSP would have to prove to their 3PAO that they have a written policy or ideally policy-as-code that they only source images from their own select container registries and not directly from registries on the Internet.   We had this exact issue initially in our environment where developers were pulling images from multiple locations including directly from internet registries.   If there is business need for supporting other registry types including internet-based 3rd party registry types in the inventory, this could be treated as a backlog feature and prioritized based on demand or something the community member adds themselves to the code.   

I agree on VMs that they are subjective.   If the VM is part of a scaleset and the CSP can show to the 3PAO via policy or policy-as-code that the VM is essentially immutable after deployment from the base VM, then it is simplest to just treat as an Immutable VM Base Image type in inventory.   If changes can happen to the VM after deployment, then it would need to be part of the OS/Infrastructure base type.

The version tag seems to be significant here. If a vulnerability was found in a given container image, the version tag would be needed to identify which container version needs to be remedied and to verify that a fix was in place in a future version to address the vulnerability.

Yes the version tag is critically important- the deployed version(s) are what is actually scanned. The use of the base image is more a mechanical question regarding how vulnerability aging should be tracked- approach of tracking aging against the container image with version tag leads to scenarios where updating the image resets the clock on vulnerability aging, which was deemed to be undesirable behavior. 

We engaged extensively with the PMO last year on this topic and the determination was that vulnerabilities are best associated with the "persistent element" - the container image that performs a specific function within the system. I think this approach makes sense- If I am using an nginx container image, then vulnerabilities found with deployed version(s) of my nginx container image should age as long as _any_ versions of that container image in my system have the vulnerability. Once all versions of that container image deployed in the environment are using a version which does not have the vulnerability, then the vulnerability can be considered remediated. If in the future a version of nginx is deployed in the system which has that specific vulnerability then we will _reopen the existing vulnerability_ as opposed to treating it like a "new" vulnerability.

I took a look at some of the leading registry solutions. Here is a quick list. There are generally two choices for identifiers the tag or the sha-256 hash, either can be used as a reference. The hash of course has the advantage of representing the content of the image itself. I would suggest we keep both identifiers in the inventory data for containers along with common attributes across leading container solutions.

@cybersechawk container image inventorying is featuring in multiple threads. Attempting to keep things DRY so linking to https://github.com/FedRAMP/rev5-continuous-monitoring-cwg/discussions/12#discussioncomment-12713815 where I think the above points are addressed.

Key thing is that we have chosen after much back and forth with the PMO to express the thing as the combination of what it is (`nginx`, etc) with _where it comes from_ (e.g. `013241004608.dkr.ecr.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com`. There may be a better way to slice this for meaningful representation in the inventory and easy correlation with scan results and finding management but we have not found one yet.

@atfurman and @cybersechawk @jsantore-cgc it's very interesting that this particular topic (tracking container inventory over time) keeps getting brought up by many people over multiple working groups as a cornerstone. Seems like it's top of mind for people who are "hands-on-keyboard" engineering FedRAMP workloads ;)

Inventory representation for ephemeral resources in general has been a problematic area for my entire FedRAMP adjacent career. 

Hoping we'll be able to make some real progress on developing internally consistent and usable guidance and associated standards and specifications as part of this initiative- one of my primary perceived difficulties with FedRAMP to date has been that a great deal of discussion and ostensible decision making happens in the silo of email threads but then doesn't ever seem to make it into general purpose guidance. If we can change that alone then I think that this will have been a worthy endeavor.

We generate the OSCAL inventory from the AWS and Azure inventory APIs.  Container images change multiple times per day and every time the PR changes the image, a Lambda or Azure Function fires that re-generates the OSCAL inventory.  If folks want that code as open source +1

A lot of folks jumped straight into automation and advanced topics while some of us are still focused on the importance of understanding the system scope and inventory. None of the other ideas will be effective if CSPs do not have an accurate (and consistently accurate over time) inventory of the assets. 

Part of it too is having visibility into many CSPs, like you and I have, helps with understanding just how bad most CSPs are at this effort. Showing up for a gap assessment, readiness/initial assessment, or even an annual assessment involves manually discovering boundary/inventory inconsistencies more often than not.

@Bscudera9 and others I'd be interested in your thoughts around what the most prevalent shortcomings are when it comes to inventory management today (high level only - please nothing attributable or exploitable!), and if there are ways that those can be improved with low cost/effort via specific policies?

Pretty complex topic, but first few things that come to mind would be:

1. Missing accounts/subscriptions (and therefore underlying assets). It may seem obvious but quite a few CSPs are doing simple exports of 'Network Interfaces' from EC2 and missing entire accounts. Scripting / automation to create inventories would require some level of Org / Accounting-level review of charges and attributions to FedRAMP enclave or not.
2. Old images intermingled with updated images. Goes to my other comment of static systems like SIEM, databases, scanners, sometimes bastion hosts, etc. These can be missed and sometimes are only identified by a reviewer evaluating scan data.
3. Snapshotting to remove old assets and add new assets. Timing of this with scans can be a challenge especially if there are manual efforts to collect asset identifiers or attributes (including secondary / management IPs). This may be where others would point to auto-scaling or ephemeral assets but honestly that is easy for a human to understand when identifying a delta between scans / inventory specific to a subnet / ip range.

On top of all of the above, some CSPs just aren't doing the very basics. They shrug off deltas from scans / inventory or they don't look at that at all. They have misconfigured scans. They have poorly defined system scope. They misunderstand what is an inventory asset and what is not.

> CSPs just aren't doing the very basics

THIS. As it relates to the top post - how do we create trust based on transparency if the Agency doesn't have the data (eg inventory and scan files?)  We just assume trust day 1 with no operational history? I would not be comfortable with that as an AO but let them opine.

Maybe establish trust levels based on performance? So maybe if you achieve a maturity level X for time period Y - by doing all the basics - you get to pull back from the raw data requirements because you earned trust.  (Of course if you are higher maturity, you are not really that worried about producing automated reports/files, your code does that). 

Maybe that reduces burden *for the Agency*.  If the Agency wants less raw data, because they don't have (or don't want?) the automation to process that raw data - so be it.  In commercial enterprises this is often the case - they don't want to "own" the risk and they want to push it off to cyber insurance of the CSP.

> The template also asks for an inventory of Software. However, this will be a challenging and potentially complex category, so I  would suggest a phased approach where we start simply with the first two, and then later expand the feature set.

I agree with agile/iterative approach overall. That said, various SBOM formats exist that can be converted into OSCAL inventory JSON/yaml/XML.  Happy to contribute open source script to do so if anyone +1s

This group is focused on "the development of continuous monitoring reports, and how these reports for CSPs with FedRAMP Rev. 5 authorizations will be developed to meet agency needs." 

@ryan-hodges-gsa , to progress forward on Simplified Inventory Reporting that meets CM-8 requirements, I am thinking the following:
* Work with the community to create an open-source MVP automation and set of inventory report files
* Iteratively refine the solution based on community feedback

We could potentially build off of work already done by @austinsonger (see https://github.com/Elevated-Standards )  or work in this area that other CSPs may be willing to contribute code.   

Do you think it would be best to wait until the next meeting to discuss the approach?   It would be good to see who could contribute time to help develop and who might be able to contribute with work they have already done in this area to automate.

hey @paulagosta / @ryan-hodges-gsa / @sam-aydlette ,   I am wondering if a good place to start would be to collect code and scripts that people are willing to contribute for this area into a working group repository.   We have at least one community member here @sunstonesecure-robert  that would be willing to contribute code for inventory gathering, @austinsonger had code and I will see if we can contribute as well.   This would provide a starting point and then as a community, we could refine the scripts further by commenting on the solutions or even starting to coordinate together as a team and extend the solutions so that they are easy for CSPs to use within their own environments.    It would be helpful, I think, to see if additional people in the community would be willing to contribute and also to see if AWS and/or other hyperscalers could help as well since we are essentially pulling together inventory using their APIs but just what is required for FedRAMP and in a format usable for automation.

@cybersechawk .  This is a public working forum and your idea is well within scope of this group.  Any work done here for the betterment of this community I am sure would be appreciated.

That being said, I will caveat that the PMO team will be very limited in contributions/engagements in this effort.  The government is  obligated to stay vendor agnostic and ensure there is no appearance of endorsement or favoritism towards any products or services.  Any support prioritizing efforts or supporting script development could imply otherwise.

@paulagosta Don't want to violate the spirit of the community here - but - if you are ok and folks want to talk open source scripts in the CNCF (open source, not for profit) arena, I can post a link to the CNCF Compliance Workgroup meetings where this is exactly what we talk about, so as to segregate these threads from any particular implementation recommendation.  If that's bad form - I won't. Please advise on the rules of the road you prefer. Thanks!

I agree with @sunstonesecure-robert in the open-source, not for profit, CNCF collaborative approach.   The majority of FedRAMP  requirements are around things that companies should already be doing as part of their Security teams and are things that other compliance programs require as well.   The foundation of good Security starts with complete inventory, so whatever is developed in this area for CM-8 is generally something needed by most Security teams anyways and is required by most commercial compliance programs.   So in other words, if we can create a collection of scripts that simply generate inventory across cloud platforms, if we do it right then this solution could be used to meet not only FedRAMP inventory requirements but also the similar inventory requirements across common compliance programs.   Cloud providers already provide API's and CLI's that get you most of the way towards what FedRAMP requires.   However, you do need a solution that addresses the ephemeral nature of container inventory, that can output inventory in a format reviewable by 3PAO/PMO/Agency and that provides you an easy way to detect unexpected changes, so there are a few things that are needed.

Hmmm...all very interesting discussions. I find it fascinating that a control framework such as FedRAMP tries to nail down in a document what an inventory is at a very specific point in time, all the while, the true, real inventory is in the cloud environment. Why try to copy it all down into a spreadsheet? And I get that we all want to ensure scans cover everything that it's supposed to, and I also get that there are so many interpretations and methods used to scan an environment, what to scan, etc. It's easy to want to dive into the details, and necessary for sure, but stepping up 1000 feet looking down at this process, we do create a lot of paperwork here in FedRAMP.

With that said, it makes sense for FedRAMP to establish the expectations and then leave it up to the CSP to meet that, and have it independently tested to validate the effectiveness of scanning-to-inventory approaches. We want to do this effectively, so that TRUST can be achieved. Keeping vulnerability management where it belongs - in the CSP environment - is the best approach to take. The control framework (and let's say a KSI framework) should set the expectation, the CSPs should then implement it, and it should be independently evaluated at a defined frequency. 

No more inventory spreadsheets, keep it all in the CSP environment, and report on it continuously. Agencies need to be able to trust that the CSP is doing the right things, and by leaning on independent evaluation, they should be able to feel more confident in the continuous results being shared by a CSP in this new 20x approach. 

I've provided ideas on a CSP Security Posture Dashboard that I call to be the central presentation of continuous monitoring results, which would include reporting on scanning results, KSI results, etc. I called for a set of core KSIs by Control Domain, and also allow the capability for a CSP to add KSI's on the fly, to allow CSPs to provide details on what the KSI is, how it's measured, be able to provide descriptions of how they implemented and measure the KSI, present results in a Control Domain perspective both from an aggregate and trending perspective, in essence attempting to eliminate all paperwork associated to FedRAMP, i.e. SSP, POAMs, Inventory, etc. 

The nitty-gritty details of "how" a CSP is going to automate things is quite honestly not FedRAMP's concern. That's our problem. The control framework should just express what is required. Let the CSPs determine the how, and have it independently tested so everyone can trust the results of continuous monitoring. Create the method of how we can communicate our results. I see it as that simple. All the complexity will get figured out CSP-by-CSP. Try to resist the urge to dictate **how** a CSP should do something...lol...I know that's hard haha. :-)

So, from my perspective, starting with a simplified inventory reporting approach is the wrong first step. How about establish the core set of KSIs per control family, and I bet the requirements around inventory will flush out naturally, My 2cents for whatever it's worth. :-)

> Try to resist the urge to dictate how a CSP 

The NIST controls - while not in any way perfect, or even often relevant to cloud-native - define in most cases the "what" - not the "how".  Sure there are some FedRAMP parameters that stridently define "how" elements.  But overall I think a reasonable read of most of the 800-53 r5 controls leave lots of room for interpretation and innovation.

Asking CSPs to define how they plan and how they actually do implement that is not asking too much IMHO.  In my experience, anything that is not audited can and will be ignored.  I prefer the threat->risk approach of rank sorting which controls an Agency feels are most important and focusing the control selections (whether for initial ATO or annuals) based on that agency approved rank sort.  That said, if the CSP doesn't have a threat model - how can the Agency make that risk decision...
