Hi, Kenny. I am just one of the advocates for 1/4 the working groups, but you reminded me that someone else made a welcome thread with much more traffic from other participants like you! You might want to check out https://github.com/FedRAMP/rev5-continuous-monitoring-cwg/discussions/8 and say hi there. I'll completely close this one out now. ðŸ˜„
