          "body": "For sure, @aj-stein-gsa! My automated Bayesian approach uses LLMs to establish a valuable baseline risk analysis, generally assuming a \"typical, moderately secure\" environment. The need for specific context arises in \"fringe cases\" where an organization significantly deviates from that baseline \u2013 for example, through their actual choices for organization-defined parameters (like AC-1 review frequency or SI-2 patch times), the specifics of their technical implementations (e.g., SC-13 crypto choices or IA-5(7) code scanning rigor), unique supply chain dependencies (SR-11/SR-12 vendor realities), or even their operational culture. This context is crucial because it directly informs the actual control effectiveness probabilities (like `P(B)` or `P(B|A))`, allowing refinement of the LLM's initial estimates and highlighting why human oversight remains essential to ensure the final risk assessment accurately reflects the specific environment.",

Modeling the \"labels\" to an example typical, moderately secure system re control goals and their consequences I think I understand qualitatively. However, it's harder for me to get rooted in these quantitative methods.\r\n\r\nSo, we look forward to reading more!",

          "body": "This is really interesting @chrisjohnson1, thank you! A few clarifying questions. First, using this approach who in your mind would be responsible for owning the Bedrock instance (or equivalent) and performing this analysis on the CSV input? Would that be the CSP whose data is being analyzed, or the Agency customer? Second, how would the content of the control implementation statement itself be verified? Would it make sense that the content be in quantitative form where possible (i.e., relying on measurable outputs from IAM, vuln scan tools, etc. rather than a human writing a subjective paragraph based on their interpretation)?",

          "body": "Howdy, @sam-aydlette! The intent is to make this an open-source standard that any CSP can adopt. The analysis can be self-hosted or handled by a SaaS provider\u2014totally flexible, depending on the organization\u2019s preference.\r\n\r\nAs you mentioned, all control content gets quantified using the Bayes Risk score. Our current thinking is that relevant signals (IAM, vuln scans, logs, etc.) get scraped via Prometheus and published to a ledger database. That way, everything is measurable, tamper-evident, and auditable. But unlike public blockchains, this ledger isn\u2019t visible to the world.\u00a0Access is strictly limited\u00a0to the parties who need to validate the system's security:\r\n\r\n* The Cloud Service Provider (CSP)\r\n* The consuming Agency(ies)\r\n* The authorized Third-Party Assessors (3PAOs)\r\n\r\n**No one else.** This permissioned ledger is designed for\u00a0shared trust between verified participants, not public exposure.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re aiming for full transparency and automation with minimal subjectivity. Here\u2019s the post that outlines the ledger DB piece: https://www.knoxsystems.com/blog/fedramp-ledger-part2\r\n\r\nI would love your take on how we can refine this further or where you'd see pitfalls.",
