I've personally developed software that reports inventory and POAM requirements for the FedRamp program, and I'm currently working on new solutions where I intend to help bring the FedRamp 20x roadmap to fruition. \r\n\r\nI'm very excited that we are all collaborating through Git. I'm hopeful for what the future will bring as we help enhance the current process. :) ",
