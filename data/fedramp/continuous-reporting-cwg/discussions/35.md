# Post

In my personal capacity, I created a GitHub organization to create in the coming weeks one or more example cloud service offerings with application and infrastructure code. And without further ado, here is the GitHub organization for Super Cool Example Cloud, or SCE Cloud if you are into the whole brevity thing. (Regrettably I'm the person that came up with Awesome Cloud for previous examples but it turns out [there's now a real cloud service provider using that name](https://awesome.cloud), so no more of that. ðŸ˜¢ )

https://github.com/scecloud

Astute readers will notice two things.

First off, this organization is completely empty for now. I'll be working on this on an ad hoc basis to build the notional app(s) and their supporting infrastructure. To start, there will be a website hosted that explains the story of the imaginary company it's first cloud service offering and their intention to have it meet FedRAMP 20X requirements.

Secondly, you will notice that I use another GitHub account that is not tied to my official work products. It is in fact me, rest assured. I note that with my work account here, so it is above board. To make it very clear, I built a separate GitHub organization with that other account because it is not officially connected to anything by FedRAMP. None of my colleagues will officially endorse that work. However, if you wanna get involved, you can comment here if you are interested in collaborating on work there.

**NOTE:** Apologies as I tried to find the specific thread, but was unable to quickly; remind me in a post if you know you are and I can update this message later and credit you.

@aj-stein-gsa This is a great idea!  One of the things I always wanted to do and never got around to is to make a hypothetical generic environment (I called it Acme Cloud until I could find something funnier).  

I wanted a boundary diagram, a tech stack, etc, and wanted to use to for training new folks (on the 3PAO side) so that everyone had a common reference point, common artifacts (SSP, fake 'evidence') and could use this as an example for all kinds of things, both for assessors and advisors.  As with everything, there's the whole 'in my copious free time' problem.  I was *not* however, getting into IAC or anything like that.

Let me know how I can help in any way.  I am completely onboard with this.

(side note as a non-github expert.  I can see that it exists but it is not public, so not sure if that's current state, by design, or if you need to invite people to participate or whatever).

I will keep you and others in the loop.

Well, I was out on personal leave. I will be working on it, but it was very much empty the week I was out. You see exactly what I see as a member of the GitHub organization. More to follow!

I don't know if existing cloud simulation platforms will help. One of the popular products is CloudSim https://github.com/Cloudslab/cloudsim

Thanks for the pointers, @Cybonto, and interest, @jsantore-cgc. We will close this announcement for now. Those who are interested can follow the (woefully minimal for now) updates to the landing page for the imaginary company and project. You can open up issues for information, feature requests for relevant upcoming app/ops/security stuff, or express interest to volunteer at the issue board below.
