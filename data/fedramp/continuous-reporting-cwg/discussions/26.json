  "body": "What are folks ideas on the the ideal way for agencies to consume continuous reporting for the CSOs they are leveraging? E.g., customer accessible CSP managed dashboard, API integration, etc. Does it make sense to create standard API specifications that agencies can use to integrate CSO reporting with their own tooling (EMASS, CSAM, etc.)? Would it make more sense to align on reporting metrics on the FedRAMP Marketplace itself? All ideas are welcome...",

The CSP Dashboard contains the results of KSI metrics (presentation of which is in a Control Domain perspective - not every nitty-gritty NIST Rev5 control). A shift to a Control Domain presentation of results has significant advantages in simplifying and streamlining the presentation of results. \r\n\r\nI agree that an API should be considered to make it easier for the Agency as well, not just the CSP, and potentially aligning eMASS to a new shift to a Control Domain presentation of results would I suspect make everyone using eMASS cheer with great joy. :-)\r\n\r\nI like the FedRAMP Marketplace idea, but build it out to see the CSP Dashboard, and perhaps automate the authorization process via a simple workflow engine.

          "body": "> Interesting, can you explain more about that preference and your other compromise option?\r\n\r\nI believe leveraging the marketplace as a means for consolidating information is beneficial. Otherwise, we'll need to navigate to hundreds of different CSP sites to view various types of dashboards. Standardization is preferable, and having one central location makes reviewing and selection easier. Even if we were to put this information behind a portal, limiting access to federal employees (but not to the same extent as package by package access in the current process), would be my preferred compromise if direct ingestion isn't viable. \r\n\r\nObviously, ingestion to our own dashboard would be the preferred avenue, but I would assume that would be only once we've officially established a contract with the vendor, so it might come down to a central PMO owned site for initial review like the marketplace, then internal agency ingestion.\r\n\r\n> Can you explain more what you are capable of ingesting more frequently than monthly? And if so, how you are able to do it more frequently? I am happy to get more of an agency perspective here, thanks for providing your take.\r\n\r\nWe currently collect data from various tools deployed in the environment: vuln scans, end point management, EDR, MDM. We centralize the collection from throughout the agency and then ETL for ingestion. We've also centralized logging, but that hasn't been integrated into our dashboarding tool....yet. We do have custom built dashboards within the SIEM to handle various reviews.\r\n\r\nWhile data ingest occurs each day, we aren't necessarily scanning our full environment each day, it's broken up over time and reports in following scans, but we have to meet the BOD so it's certainly every week at minimum. ETL picks up vuln repositories each day, refreshing any stale data with new data.\r\n\r\nIt is a significant amount of data and the ETL process can be slow, but if were looking at modernization I believe this is a good opportunity to enhance our process and adopt better ways to collect our data.",

Hope that answers your question.\r\n\r\nSorry I didn't reply sooner, @JosephScarzone, thanks for the follow-up and the transparency. We do appreciate that. Any insights, given this experience, on how to make the reporting process itself more efficient from your end and uploading to a repository? (I know it likely would not be the current FedRAMP-maintained one or even a similar one in the future, but more detail around this would be helpful.)\r\n",
