When I was running Ops and Security for a SAAS, that was our starting point for any monitoring or reporting we would do.\r\n\r\nGood points. When working in SecOps for a SaaS, you would allow outside customers and tentative customers to see some subset of the information from a SIEM? If so, what data? Perhaps we can use that to inform what in the reports and the consumer.\r\n\r\n> So who are the consumers of this reporting? Agency ISO's? FedRAMP PMO? 3PAO's? and what should trigger some sort of action from them?\r\n\r\nWe in FedRAMP don't have a set answer around that yet. Comments and posts like yours inform how we best determine that as a community. What's your take?\r\n",

What \"worked\" from the metrics selected and collected and what didn't? Or did they not change over time and they were solid. There is a lot of overlap with the [Automating Assessment CWG posts](https://github.com/FedRAMP/automating-assessment-cwg/discussions) re this question, but one thing this CWG could benefit from is deeper thought and experimentation around how you roll up KSI data and what are meaningful measurements (even if only for executives to start). So, details welcome!\r\n\r\n> I think one of the big concerns that an outside customer would have is how to verify that the data being fed to them is accurate.

If you're interested on how we incrementally build solutions to that higher level need, you are in the right place. That is a key focus of this CWG.\r\n\r\n> With your current ConMon process for vulnerabilities you are getting the raw scan files in addition to the POA&M report, so you would have a mechanism for verification.

To be clear about our FedRAMP perspective, we have to service agency customers in GSA outside of FedRAMP to provide them a marketplace listing and information to make informed decisions about cloud service offerings they use in other GSA programs.
