Can you point specifically to what feature or offering Ask Sage provides to customers or tentative customers to evaluate Ask Sage for their use? For example, [this page explains how to customers will use the product after acquisition for themselves](https://docs.asksage.ai/docs/in-a-box/compliance-cyber/compliance-cyber.html), but I have not found concrete information about the platform itself for customers to evaluate.

We strongly prefer examples with details in the CWG boards. 😄

@aj-stein-gsa Our documentation page describes Ask Sage functionality, which is how we automated 100% of the SSP package, and 95% of our ConMon deliverables. I replied with more detail on another thread, but yeah, it's so simple it's kind of crazy when you think about it. The use of AI through Ask Sage basically has increased our productivity probably by 150%. My CEO did it all by himself using Ask Sage. And I now manage our various ATOs by myself as well, and so yeah, for me, with all the other LLM options out there, I choose Ask Sage every time! The documentation link explains how, in essence. :-)

Sounds interesting, perhaps publish some more details about that 150% and it will pique the interest of people in the CWG? Again, we're nitty gritty details people. 😄

@JosephScarzone, do you work for Nick and Ask Sage, or are you a consumer of the Ask Sage product and have an independent listing in the marketplace? This is important as it would speak towards a non-biased opinion on practical and real-world usage of a product, process, and industry adoption. 

Additionally, do you have any repositories for public review? I am very interested in what you are proposing.

@chrisjohnson1 Yes, I do. So, maybe a little biased, but in different way. Before coming to Ask Sage, I worked for a 3PAO and was assigned to lead and perform the Ask Sage Initial FedRAMP High + DoD IL5 assessment. I knew nothing of the product or CEO, and audited the hell out of the Ask Sage solution. I was pretty impressed to say the least. And so, I have formally provided an independent evaluation of the product before joining Ask Sage to lead their ATO compliance efforts. 

My praise of the product by using it now is personal and would use Ask Sage whether I worked for Nic or not. I mean it when I say that out of all the LLM options out there, I choose Ask Sage every time. It's that good, it provides the most and best flexibility, and it's feature rich. In any case, learning how to use AI is all of our mandates to do. I can see and have witnessed how AI can be used in every industry to increase velocity of individual production. And so, the route we all are taking here should lead us to how AI can be leveraged to streamline implementing, maintaining and reporting on the security posture of a CSP (or any governance framework for that matter). 

Regarding your public review comment, what exactly are you looking for?

Thanks for that, @JosephScarzone - I appreciate the transparency and background. 

> Regarding your public review comment, what exactly are you looking for?

Presumably, AI or an agentic approach would be just a component of the process; however, information regarding vulnerabilities would need to be supplied using some type of ETL process. I suspect an API or some agent-based workflow has already been developed. It would be great to see how you all use the product for ConMon, what the inputs are, what the outputs are, and what the expectations are for usage.

Some papers I am reading because I have been curious what "the literature" (to be cute about it) says about the concepts of continuous reporting and monitoring as it applies to cloud security outside tools and cloud service offerings themselves. Interestingly enough, I found some familiar names among authors today, but need to chase down the graph of citations and see what has changed from 2010s to now.

Below is an export of papers I am looking at and seeing their related evidence and tools implemented.

Some more interesting researching I discovered this week, in addition to what I posted in https://github.com/FedRAMP/continuous-reporting-cwg/discussions/39#discussioncomment-13064720 last week, I found on social media when some were discussing it: "[Evidence-based cybersecurity policy? A meta-review of security control effectiveness](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23738871.2024.2335461)."
