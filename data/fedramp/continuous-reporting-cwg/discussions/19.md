I realize way back when I never introduced myself and will do it here so it is easy to find for the newcomers. Hi, I'm AJ and I'm one of the facilitators of this community working group and a data scientist here in FedRAMP. You can find out more about me on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/aj-stein-gsa) if you want more detail. I look forward to learning more from all of you!

Hi Team!

My name is Chris Johnson, and I'm currently the Chief Services Officer for CoSo Cloud. I have been working with FedRamp for a little more than 10 years. I've personally developed software that reports inventory and POAM requirements for the FedRamp program, and I'm currently working on new solutions where I intend to help bring the FedRamp 20x roadmap to fruition. 

I'm very excited that we are all collaborating through Git. I'm hopeful for what the future will bring as we help enhance the current process. :)

Larry Hughes (VP of R&D) from Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) here. CSA works with some 15,000 global volunteers to define and raise awareness of best practices for cloud security. We believe that our STAR program (Security Trust Assurance and Risk) and Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM), which have played an proven role in the cloud security ecosystem since 2013, can play an important role in FedRAMP 20x.
