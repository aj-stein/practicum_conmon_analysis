# Post

Hello everyone - What are your perspectives on how FedRAMP could best facilitate automated decision making between agencies and customers that is efficient and scalable.

Please feel free to provide your ideas, examples, and any additional considerations.

Hi - maybe an idea would be to integrate vulnerability data like CVE scores or threat feeds into the FedRAMP marketplace?

Can you explain a little more on how you would expect that to work, @gabbynguyen1? CVEs may (but are not required to) [publish CVSS base scores](https://cve.mitre.org/blog/September112018_A_Look_at_the_CVE_and_CVSS_Relationship.html#:~:text=CVE%2C%20CVSS%2C%20and%20NVD,NVD%20website%20to%20learn%20more.), and even when they do, they need to be contextually scored for that CVE as applicable in a specific application and configuration, be it a FedRAMP-authorized service or not. It would be great to know how you would envision that works.

I would recommend using a generative AI solution (such as my company's Ask Sage AI Generative Platform) to analyze the CSP Security Posture Dashboard results and make a first attempt at an authorization decision, to then be reviewed by a human by using a simple workflow engine that is transparent and simple to use. Human validates the AI decision, determines it is reasonable or unreasonable, and finalize the decision.

Re https://github.com/FedRAMP/continuous-reporting-cwg/discussions/39#discussioncomment-13053477, can you give some more detail about how the platform facilitates the automated sharing with some concrete examples (around published vulnerability findings with CVE like Gabby proposed or some other area of interest)?

I did read through some of the documentation for your platform offerings re that other comment, but I did not find much that I would expect in continuous reporting for customers and/or to their environment. This CWG is focused on future state, so we start clean state and I am not resurfacing recent Rev 5 Continuous Monitoring requirements and will not request your cloud service offering's FedRAMP package. ðŸ˜„

@aj-stein-gsa LOL, even if you did, we could easily accommodate. :-)

Ask Sage generative AI platform produced 100% of the SSP package using the In-a-Box functionality (no joking!). 95% of our ConMon monthly submissions are produced by Ask Sage. The 5% that's manually done takes us minutes to update. The documentation link I provided you is the actual answer. Our platform is rich with features that helps us automate practically anything we want to, and we use various methods as described in our documentation to do it, such as defined Personas, In-a-Box, Connectors via APIs, defined Connectors to GitHub and code, our Code Canvas feature, and pre-defined Prompt Engineering all contribute to the way Ask Sage is used to automate compliance activities. (but so much more than that, but we're just talking FedRAMP now). :-)

The use of AI is the future state. I guess I'm lucky, as I'm sitting on the most premiere FedRAMP High, DoD IL5 with S and TS fabrics generative AI platform on the planet...lmao...one of the reasons why I came to work for Ask Sage from my former role with one of the top 3PAOs in the country. I've had a 34-year career, seen much change in the world, and AI is just another technology with will change everything. And so, when you say that the CWG is focused on future state, I'm right there with you. We all want to automate this process, then AI must be leveraged to do it, in my humble opinion. 

Become a customer my friend, and I'll show you how LOL! :-)

Good to know, thanks.

Thanks for the explanation. Just a heads up (or maybe a reminder) about this specific CWG: we are [focused on future state beyond the past and near-term requirements and deliverables](https://www.fedramp.gov/20x/working-groups/reporting/) around traditional Rev5 SSP, SAPs, SARs, POAMs, and attached evidence data (and their formats) accepted by precedent. A lot of the probing questions, to you and others, is to better understand what that future state should entail based upon industry value, _not_ primarily or exclusively because "FedRAMP said so" or "well, FedRAMP has accepted it the last N years."

Moreover, this group is focused on the mechanisms of reporting for future state that industry wants or needs, not traditionally submitting package and Continuous Monitoring information (notice this group does not use ConMon in its name or messaging at all) via max.gov and connect.gov. We talk about very different topics and focuses from [the related CWG you also post on](https://github.com/FedRAMP/rev5-continuous-monitoring-cwg/discussions), notice I do not frequent that. Our focus here is very different, so I engage here and the [automating assessments CWG](https://github.com/FedRAMP/automating-assessment-cwg/discussions/) about future state and my really passion: how will we send it to each other over the wire. (Notice "we" as in all of in the forum and "over the wire" is vague hand-waving; this CWG informs details around that and none are set in stone yet.)

So if possible, we would really appreciate more detail about how this works for you and customers beyond the documentation I reviewed on your site.

That is good to know, and I appreciate your explanation of your background. I will just repeat this CWG is focused on the future, not the past approaches from current state of the FedRAMP and 3PAO ecosystem, unless we identify specific methods and why we should move them forward integrally into a new methodology separate from Rev5 based processes.

More generally, you notice our staff limit how much we talk about our credentials and experience, in FedRAMP and out. [I was more specific about this than others](https://youtu.be/juTMrGv4KR8?t=268). So maybe you can dive deeper into those methods that did work from that experience and accreditation processes and why we should adapt them for the future? With or without AI, I would like _all_ participants to show a little more detail about what, how, and why they do it separate of the whom and their bona fides.

So tell us more of the what, how, and why in the AskSage security systems as inputs and outputs that make it a great role and why you enjoy securing that system. How do customers engage with those outputs and how should that inform this CWG's future ideas?

> Become a customer my friend, and I'll show you how LOL! :-)

Unfortunately, that is not how this CWG, FedRAMP, and GSA work more generally. Specifically, the point of CWG is to have multiple partners show us industry approaches that can be adopted by the group, and that kind of engagement means without me being a customer or marketing the overall solution. We're the nitty gritty details people in this group. We want to see the details because the philosophy of FedRAMP hasn't changed: we are here to inform customers of good solutions, not be your direct customers. ðŸ˜„ 

And thanks for replying, I value every increase in transparency, I'll just keep asking for more until I reach every CWG member's respective limit.

There has been a lot of good discussion on this topic in the last few weeks, but we are going to close this one for now. We will open up new posts for commenting accordingly around different facets of this topic when the time is right, or you can when it is right for you, fellow community members!
