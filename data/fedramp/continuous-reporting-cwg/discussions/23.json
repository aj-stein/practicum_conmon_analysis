  "title": "Level Setting Expectations",
  "body": "> Initial Outcome: No later than the conclusion of the first two meetings, create and approve a project plan with overall direction including outcomes, timelines, and milestones\r\n\r\nI don't want to start off by being a debbie downer here, but I was reading through the [plan documentation ](https://github.com/FedRAMP/continuous-reporting-cwg/blob/main/plan.md#key-community-working-groups-activities) and couldn't help notice the aforementioned initial outcome. While I agree that having deadlines is important to set a sense of urgency, creating an artificial time box may not be in the best interests of a new community working group. \r\n\r\nIn the spirit of open-source collaboration and transparency, establishing a code of conduct, contribution process, and communication channels would be utilizing best practices for the initial meeting. Diving straight into problem solving without any governance isn't setting the CWG up for long-term continued success. Having those three artifacts would at a minimum help ensure that the limited time allotted to the CWG is spent wisely, while also providing ground rules for asynchronous work and communication (of which I anticipate all CWGs will have more of than meetings). \r\n\r\nThe other concern with the initial outcome would be the discrete outcomes, timelines, and milestones that the CWG is expected to deliver. Iterative success is going to lead to overall success. The CWG should be tasked with an initial outcome to establish how collaboration should function, which includes things like when meetings occur, how communication is handled, etc. Asking for a project plan with milestones is likely beyond the maturity of a newly formed entity.\r\n\r\nAgain, I want to stress that I'm not downplaying the need for solutions here. But I want to make sure we have expectations aligned with how fast the CWG will be able to effectively work in the beginning, particularly while the community is still adapting to the existence of the WG. Establishing (and utilizing) governance will only increase the group's efficiency and success down the road. \r\n",

          "body": "Hi @jblaher  thank you for the feedback. I have two follow up questions for you. \r\n1. For the code of conduct, contribution process, and communication channels you described, what additional formal documents or governance structures/processes do you feel need to be in place above and beyond what is currently defined in the existing plan? Or would updating the plan itself with more detail be sufficient? \r\n2. Regarding your second point, do you feel that establishing an overall plan with defined expected outcomes at the outset of the CWG restricts the ability to iterate? I'm curious what you would recommend as an alternative approach to ensure the group stays aligned on an established direction concurrent with achieving the overall CWG goals.",

      "body": "Clarifying a few issues here:\r\n\r\n1) All of this content is still kinda flexing as we head towards launch, and will continue to flex afterwards. The purpose of these working groups isn't to direct work on behalf of the government, so we'll make sure to clarify and update the initial outcome section of the docs.\r\n\r\n2) We are not able to set up governance as you've mentioned due to policy and legal restrictions. This is **public** with all the good and bad (we're the government and not going to mess with your first amendment rights). Violations of the GitHub TOS will be reported to GitHub, though.\r\n\r\nThanks for being passionate and interested; we'll sort things out as we go.\r\n",

      "body": "Copy that @pete-gov. I do find it interesting to build part of an open-source model without that level set, but it's new territory for all of us here. \r\n\r\nFor @sam-aydlette, I think to me the biggest thing is really just time. The outcomes to me read as a definitive, specifically when it mentions milestones and timelines. I don't think the CWG will be able to collectively agree on what the desired outcome is by the end of the second 30 minute call. I anticipate there will be a lot more participation from the community than expected and that will naturally slow things down. I would also say that it should be up to the community to decide when to present a first run at outcomes. It just reads as more aspirational than it was likely intended to be, but I just want to make sure we're all coming into this with roughly the same expectations of how fast can things be done. ",

          "body": "> Copy that @pete-gov. I do find it interesting to build part of an open-source model without that level set, but it's new territory for all of us here.\r\n\r\nSo full disclosure, @jblaher, Sam and I are [both advocates for this group](https://github.com/FedRAMP/continuous-reporting-cwg/blob/0ad668026b78116f6e3a5d2cc6fa026c0bcf5f1d/plan.md#interaction-with-fedramp). Not to meta-game, but do you have examples of an open-source project that _did_ clearly document such level setting in the beginning? I am used to \"scratching my own itch\" projects growing from the work of one or a few people stabilizing over time. Sometimes it is a very niche project, sometimes it is open-ended and ambitious, but I rarely find projects that have well-structured expectations for projects on either end or in the middle of that spectrum.\r\n\r\nTo be tongue and cheek about this, [I am more used to what I call \"the Torvalds School of planning\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20130509134305/http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.minix/msg/b813d52cbc5a044b) in open-source, but I know open-source is not a mono-culture. I am asking in earnest and in good faith.\r\n",

      "body": "It's an interesting question because most open source projects aren't as cross-sectional an issue and as well advertised as this CWG. Usually, they start as \"I have this problem and this is how I'm trying to solve it\". CNCF projects typically leverage the materials they provide (such as community code of conducts, contribution methodology, etc.) but they still have fairly narrow technical aims they wish to accomplish. \r\n\r\nAll of the CWGs currently have pretty broad mandates. Risk management is already an incredibly subjective domain and even though FedRAMP CSPs are adherent to the same framework to talk about risk, there's a lot of nuance and leeway in how each CSP carries and treats similar risks. \r\n\r\nI think we are in agreement that we should let the community dictate how the project unfurls, so to speak, which is why I'm concerned with the deadline of outcomes, with timelines and milestones, at the end of the second meeting. Having been to enough public/government meetings, things move slow and everyone deserves their opportunity to speak their piece. I just don't see it realistically happening inside sixty minutes unless the expectation of those outcomes, timelines and milestones is incredibly simple in nature... which circles back to us level setting expectations.

          "body": "On @jblaher ' s initial  point, I agree that some structure is needed before diving into problem solving, but as @pete-gov  indicates, the role of the FedRAMP PMO is not to direct but more to guide and support.   I think the details will work out organically as you and others point out gaps in the overall structure and communication plan.\r\n\r\nI agree as well that the scope of the working groups right now is very broad.   I would suggest we first break out the different types of reports needed into their own Idea threads.   This will make discussion easier and allow for deeper dive into the different report types.    I started to do this in the ConMon CWG for the reports and monitoring that are required to be proven on a monthly or regular cadence for ConMon (see https://github.com/FedRAMP/rev5-continuous-monitoring-cwg/discussions/17#discussion-8151733) .    In my experience, the regular reports needed and data needed for those reports are for the ConMon process.  \r\n\r\nThe only area that I am not clear on are what additional reports would be needed that are not ConMon related, that this Reporting CWG would cover.   It seems that the most useful and helpful outcomes of both groups would be very similar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
