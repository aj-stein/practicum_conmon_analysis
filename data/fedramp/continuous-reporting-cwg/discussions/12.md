FAIR Institute published an interesting [white paper](https://1616664.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/1616664/FAIR%20Institute%20--%20Use%20FAIR%20to%20Mature%20Your%20Cyber%20Risk%20Management%20Program%20(March%202025)%20v4.pdf) on how to quantify risk within NIST RMF

I see we are starting off strong! I am familiar with FAIR, but was unaware of this paper with the RMF+FAIR approach. I will read later today, and maybe pose some impressions and questions for you and the larger group.

@sam-aydlette: This initiative would yield results that are undoubtedly more precise when it comes to risk management. Of course, the top question that comes to mind is what agency adoption is with the FAIR framework.

With all this said, successfully implementing FAIR would have a high barrier of entry due to the required education, tooling, and policy updates to standardize its application, which, of course, would entail investment dollars for both the CSP and the consuming agency. Moreover, I was under the impression that FedRAMP 20x's spirit was to use a lens that created a sentiment that compliance was more than a checkbox or KPI. The program's outcome was to be an aggregated group of controls that rendered a boolean expression that realized the context of security posture, resulting in a simple, easy-to-digest, non-mutable object (i.e., `Encryption: true`). 

I'd like to know how something like RMF & FAIR jointly fit on the FedRAMP 20x roadmap or if this is a general internal idea about how to accomplish the vision of FedRAMP 20x

@chrisjohnson1 thank you for your insight. The RMF + FAIR white paper is posted here as an open ended jumping off point for discussion around how to represent risk in the most effective and efficient manner. Your point about the need for additional investment and complexity to achieve value from FAIR is excellent.

I would assume CSF (the paper really focuses on this framework more than RMF), RMF itself, and FAIR all feel like they have education and implementation hurdles, but I assume we get to hear about your experiences and that from others in the CWGs. Excited to hear more, Chris.

@sam-aydlette and @aj-stein-gsa: Thank you both for responding so quickly! This feedback loop is wonderful. I'm interested to know what your thoughts are on RMF and FAIR in the context of the FedRamp 20x program. Is there a vision of using these frameworks to guide the standards for tooling?

Understanding the post's rationale may help us guide our answers more accordingly.

Hi @chrisjohnson1. So the intention behind posting the question about FAIR is that representing the overall risk posture of cloud offerings to agency stakeholders in an timely, accurate and consumable manner is critical to achieving continuous reporting. While using a framework like FAIR is not the only way to achieve this, I wanted to bring it up for discussion so that folks could weigh the pros and cons of pursuing such an approach. So no, using FAIR is not necessarily the vision but it is a possibility that I wanted to make sure stakeholders provided their thoughts on.

What other possible suggested frameworks outside of FAIR would be? I'd like to know what other alternatives have already been discussed or considered.

I don't want to lose sight of the overall goal of a program like FedRAMP 20X; to have secure environments.  The end goal of any Risk Management Framework is the control, containment, or elimination of identified and unidentified risk.  Not just to measure it.  Not just to prioritize it. But to eliminate it as much as possible so that the effort to take advantage of that risk for malicious purposes becomes unrewarding or impossible. 

RMF+FAIR help prioritize remediation and inform the risk taker (government.)  Providers of services need to drive towards elimination.  Ultimately, what will happen is that risk which was de-prioritized will result in the breach.

Thanks for your feedback. One note here, risk acceptance is also a key part of risk management. Eliminating risk completely is impossible due to unknown unknowns (i.e., black swans). Even if it were possible to eliminate all risk, there would still be a need to accept some risk because the cost may outweigh the benefit in some cases. Hence the need for clear, consumable reporting so that decision-makers can make informed choices.

I think what you're driving at though is that we need to ensure that CSPs enforce a sound *security baseline* for their systems rather than purely basing risk management decisions on threats. Otherwise it will be forever a game of "whack a mole" as attackers shift to target the areas we de-prioritize. Am I on track summarizing your point this way?
