It would be great to know how you would envision that works.",

This CWG is focused on future state, so we start clean state and I am not resurfacing recent Rev 5 Continuous Monitoring requirements and will not request your cloud service offering's FedRAMP package. \ud83d\ude04 ",

          "body": "> @aj-stein-gsa LOL, even if you did, we could easily accommodate. :-)\r\n\r\nGood to know, thanks.\r\n\r\n> Ask Sage generative AI platform produced 100% of the SSP package using the In-a-Box functionality (no joking!). 95% of our ConMon monthly submissions are produced by Ask Sage. The 5% that's manually done takes us minutes to update. The documentation link I provided you is the actual answer. Our platform is rich with features that helps us automate practically anything we want to ...\r\n\r\nThanks for the explanation. Just a heads up (or maybe a reminder) about this specific CWG: we are [focused on future state beyond the past and near-term requirements and deliverables](https://www.fedramp.gov/20x/working-groups/reporting/) around traditional Rev5 SSP, SAPs, SARs, POAMs, and attached evidence data (and their formats) accepted by precedent. A lot of the probing questions, to you and others, is to better understand what that future state should entail based upon industry value, _not_ primarily or exclusively because \"FedRAMP said so\" or \"well, FedRAMP has accepted it the last N years.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, this group is focused on the mechanisms of reporting for future state that industry wants or needs, not traditionally submitting package and Continuous Monitoring information (notice this group does not use ConMon in its name or messaging at all) via max.gov and connect.gov. We talk about very different topics and focuses from [the related CWG you also post on](https://github.com/FedRAMP/rev5-continuous-monitoring-cwg/discussions), notice I do not frequent that. Our focus here is very different, so I engage here and the [automating assessments CWG](https://github.com/FedRAMP/automating-assessment-cwg/discussions/) about future state and my really passion: how will we send it to each other over the wire. (Notice \"we\" as in all of in the forum and \"over the wire\" is vague hand-waving; this CWG informs details around that and none are set in stone yet.)\r\n\r\n>  and we use various methods as described in our documentation to do it, such as defined Personas, In-a-Box, Connectors via APIs, defined Connectors to GitHub and code, our Code Canvas feature, and pre-defined Prompt Engineering all contribute to the way Ask Sage is used to automate compliance activities. (but so much more than that, but we're just talking FedRAMP now). :-)\r\n\r\nSo if possible, we would really appreciate more detail about how this works for you and customers beyond the documentation I reviewed on your site.\r\n\r\n> The use of AI is the future state. I guess I'm lucky, as I'm sitting on the most premiere FedRAMP High, DoD IL5 with S and TS fabrics generative AI platform on the planet...lmao...one of the reasons why I came to work for Ask Sage from my former role with one of the top 3PAOs in the country. I've had a 34-year career, seen much change in the world, and AI is just another technology with will change everything. And so, when you say that the CWG is focused on future state, I'm right there with you. We all want to automate this process, then AI must be leveraged to do it, in my humble opinion.\r\n\r\nThat is good to know, and I appreciate your explanation of your background. I will just repeat this CWG is focused on the future, not the past approaches from current state of the FedRAMP and 3PAO ecosystem, unless we identify specific methods and why we should move them forward integrally into a new methodology separate from Rev5 based processes.\r\n\r\nMore generally, you notice our staff limit how much we talk about our credentials and experience, in FedRAMP and out. [I was more specific about this than others](https://youtu.be/juTMrGv4KR8?t=268). So maybe you can dive deeper into those methods that did work from that experience and accreditation processes and why we should adapt them for the future? With or without AI, I would like _all_ participants to show a little more detail about what, how, and why they do it separate of the whom and their bona fides.\r\n\r\nSo tell us more of the what, how, and why in the AskSage security systems as inputs and outputs that make it a great role and why you enjoy securing that system. How do customers engage with those outputs and how should that inform this CWG's future ideas?\r\n\r\n> Become a customer my friend, and I'll show you how LOL! :-)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that is not how this CWG, FedRAMP, and GSA work more generally. Specifically, the point of CWG is to have multiple partners show us industry approaches that can be adopted by the group, and that kind of engagement means without me being a customer or marketing the overall solution. We're the nitty gritty details people in this group. We want to see the details because the philosophy of FedRAMP hasn't changed: we are here to inform customers of good solutions, not be your direct customers. \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\nAnd thanks for replying, I value every increase in transparency, I'll just keep asking for more until I reach every CWG member's respective limit.\r\n",
