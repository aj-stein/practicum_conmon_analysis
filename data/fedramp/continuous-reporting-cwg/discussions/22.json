  "title": "Effectively Reporting Cyber Hygiene Using Existing Tools",
  "body": "I've taken a crack at a set of cyber hygiene principles that are universally applicable across CSPs of different size and complexity. Defining these principles will help inform what data ought to be used to inform risk. These are meant to serve as a jumping off point for discussion, and are not authoritative.\r\n\r\n**Basic Cyber Hygiene**\r\n1. Know what your assets are and where they are \r\n2. Patch your assets\r\n3. Harden your assets\r\n4. Encrypt data at rest and in transit\r\n5. Secure authentication\r\n6. Employ least privilege\r\n7. Monitor your system\r\n8. Respond to incidents\r\n9. Perform back ups\r\n10. Empower your customers with secure default configurations\r\n\r\nWhat are people's ideas on existing tools or approaches that can effectively report these outcomes?\r\n",

      "body": "I don't know if this is going too far afield yet, but we need to account for ephemeral assets (so to your point #1 above).  It's one of the reasons getting an inventory and mapping to scan results is tricky to do.  (I'll go so far as to put on my 3PAO hat, and say inventory/scan alignment is historically the single biggest derailer for assessments).\r\n\r\nI'd say if we can find a way to define unique static asset *images* (and I mean that not just in the container sense, but from a baseline config perspective), be able to map those images to an active inventory, and reconcile those to the vuln scans we're solve one of the biggest hurdles.  Basically, some sort of a primary key that is not IP address or hostname, but that we can still use for automation (tagging, perhaps, but I'm not sure if the various scan tools can discover/track tags).\r\n\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "Hi @jsantore-cgc you bring up an excellent point, and I agree. Defining a robust tagging strategy for tracking ephemeral assets over time is a great thread to pull IMO. However, I will note that this Continuous Reporting working group is primarily focused on generation, analysis and reporting of risk whereas the meta-conversation around \"how to measure apples to apples\" is more aligned with the [Automating Assessments](https://github.com/FedRAMP/automating-assessment-cwg) CWG. So you may want to re-post this observation and suggestion there! ",

      "body": "I suggest each of the Cyber Hygiene requirements needs its own section that defines how to monitor and ensure the control(s) for each are implemented. The below example is for the \"hardening of assets\".\r\n\r\nHardening of assets can be managed via configuration scans coupled with asset tagging for approval and CI/CD for promotion. If we take a container for example, we can demonstrate that the image has been harden and that only approved images can be deployed and that all deployed containers come only from approved images.\r\n\r\n1. Demonstrate hardening: leverage tooling such as OpenSCAP in your CI/CD pipeline to confirm images have clean scans, images are tagged as approved. Access control to CI/CDE coupled with audit logging ensures only approved processed/personnel can tag an image. Images with approved tag are then promoted to a deployment repo.\r\n    - 3PAO reviews the process, access controls, and change management procedures\r\n    - CSP would provide API that confirms only approved images are in the deployment repo. The results would be used to populate a compliance dashboard.\r\n2. Approve images deployed: Restrict deployment of containers to use only the \"deployment repo\". Implement access controls and audit logging to ensure this configuration is not overridden. Add API to query what repos are approved to deploy from.\r\n    - 3PAO reviews config settings on permitted repos, access controls and audit logging configured alerts.\r\n    - While I'm not sure I would go this far, you could use audit logging of deployed image unique ids and run a validation process that confirms everyone was approved when deployed. This seems like overkill.\r\n\r\nSince the processes by which an image is confirmed to be hardened, approved and deployed doesn't change often. The process should only be assess when initially implemented and upon a significant change to the process. This would reduce the assessment time and provide robust means of ensuring all running containers were deployed from hardened images.\r\n",

          "body": "This is great @dljenkins thank you. A few follow up questions for you. Do you (or others) have any thoughts on how to represent the demonstration of hardened components effectively and concisely? The API that can be called by agency customers to validate status and/or populate a dashboard is great, but what information would be needed? Would a simple boolean yes/no work, or would the information need to incorporate the context about things like the informed deviation from a config baseline where appropriate?",

For instance, in Azure, tools like Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Azure Sentinel, etc. There are many native tools to pull information from, including log data, and so yeah, many KSIs can be addressed by these mechanisms. \r\n\r\nHaving a defined set of KSIs would be really helpful to know the scope of what's needed.
