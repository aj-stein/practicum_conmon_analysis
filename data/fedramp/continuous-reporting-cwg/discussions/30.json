  "title": "Ideas for streamlining decision making across stakeholders",
  "body": "What are folks ideas on ways to streamline post-authorization decision-making across stakeholders. Examples include:\r\n- How do CSPs stay informed of who to include from a reporting perspective for each of their agency customers on an ongoing basis?\r\n- How should collaborative decision-making work for changes that impact multiple customers with different risk tolerances?\r\n- What mechanism would be most effective for sharing information (e.g., CSP maintained API with JSON specification defined by FedRAMP, etc.)\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to use these examples or provide additional considerations.",

      "body": "I'm glad you are thinking about this particular aspect of the process. I know that perhaps there's much discussion on a decentralized or centralized process, and I get the challenges of each, however, I really encourage to still consider an online solution that all stakeholders participate in, but a very simplified one with a workflow engine underneath. This workflow mechanism kind of standardizes the authorization interaction, and presentation of what I'm calling in my head a CSP Security Posture Dashboard. Using a simple \"Invitation\" approach to viewing a CSPs Dashboard and its KSI metric results will help all FedRAMP Stakeholders be connected and obtain visibility to a CSP. \r\n\r\nCoupled with an authorization workflow that gives us a simple view of that path up to ATO authorization. Transparency and visibility would probably be the best approach, in my humble opinion, but I can't stress enough, a simple workflow solution, making it very easy to use, and then we get visibility to where we are at in the process. Keep it Simple. :-)",
