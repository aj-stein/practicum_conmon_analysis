      "body": "It's not about the framework but rather the GRC tool right?  All the evidence is collected and managed by the GRC tools.   The framework is just a description of what to collect.  \n\nTwo thoughts here.   First, do any existing frameworks have a machine readable descriptions for import into a GRC tool.   Second, what formats do existing GRC tools export findings and evidence to?\n\nThe latter question is the most important for the success of 20x implementation.   If the tool can't export, it will be rather pointless to use it other than to visually confirm compliance.  ",
