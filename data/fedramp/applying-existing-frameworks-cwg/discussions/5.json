The underlying idea isn't to simply say \"if you use framework X then you can have FedRAMP\" though, the idea is more to identify \"what _things_ produced when using an existing framework have value to potentially short cut some aspects of FedRAMP's documentation requirements?\" \r\n\r\nIs there absolutely nothing in a SOC 2 report that is worth reading to understand a company's security posture?",

          "body": "@pete-gov When it comes to FedRAMP documentation requirements, it's important to distinguish between what's required on paper versus what's validated in practice. FedRAMP places a heavy emphasis on documentation (System Security Plan, policies, procedures, etc.), but during a 3PAO assessment, the majority of the effort is focused on verifying how controls are actually implemented and operating. Documentation is important, but ultimately, what matters most is whether the described security controls are actually implemented, operating as intended, and producing effective results.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the vast majority of FedRAMP-authorized systems are separate from their commercial counterparts, and as such, many FedRAMP environments don\u2019t even undergo a SOC 2 or other commercial assessment. This separation often stems from the fact that commercial customers are generally unwilling to bear the cost of CSPs implementing certain federal requirements\u2014like FIPS 140-2 validated encryption or specific agency-driven controls like US only persons\u2014that are expensive for CSPs to maintain. As a result, providers typically isolate their federal environments to meet these obligations without impacting their broader commercial offerings. While the vision of FedRAMP 20x is signaling an interest in moving toward a model where the federal system is less isolated\u2014in the hopes of reducing cost and complexity\u2014the current posture from agencies still strongly favors separation, making commercial frameworks like SOC 2 less directly relevant in many FedRAMP contexts (I hope FedRAMP 20x is able to drive this change, but it is not going to happen overnight).\r\n\r\nSo to your question: no, it\u2019s not that a SOC 2 report has zero value. But we probably need to be clear-eyed about what types of outputs from other frameworks are actually useful in the context of FedRAMP\u2014and which aren't. There\u2019s definitely room for a broader conversation about which frameworks offer the most leverage, and why some may be less helpful based on how FedRAMP systems are structured in practice.",

          "body": "Your second paragraph explains an enduring friction point between the OMB and CSPs that this working group and FedRAMP will need to reconcile. As you mention, cloud providers tend to develop government-specific offerings instead of implementing FedRAMP standards and processes across their entire company because these additional investments are expensive to maintain and unnecessary in many (most?) commercial applications. \r\n\r\nBut the [July 2024 OMB instruction](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Policy_Memo.pdf) that sparked these working groups was _very_ specific that \"Within one year of the issuance of this memorandum, GSA will produce a plan, approved by the FedRAMP Board and developed in consultation with industry, to structure FedRAMP to encourage the transition of Federal agencies away from the use of Government-specific cloud infrastructure.\" In the best-case scenario, nearly all commercial products offered by a FedRAMP-approved vendor will become available for federal agency use, and nearly all FedRAMP standards will be integrated into CSP's \"core\" services, \"benefiting all customers.\" [page 4.]\r\n\r\nThe only way I see this working is if New FedRAMP (1) aligns very closely to an existing commercial framework or (2) comprises only the barest minimum standards and lightest-lift processes that _should_ apply to all commercial cloud offerings (regardless of whether they are reflected in current frameworks). These approaches, however, fail to address the biggest issue with FedRAMP currently: Agencies will still require any policies and procedures they feel they need, and CSOs will need to meet those demands (or convince the agencies otherwise) regardless of how much money or time they\u2019ve already spent on FedRAMP authorization.\r\n\r\nThis is a very broad generalization, and there are undoubtedly other options I am not considering. I would appreciate hearing from CSPs that have chosen to make all (or most) of their commercial offerings align with FedRAMP what frameworks they find most useful and have the most overlap with current requirements. Or perhaps, in the spirit of the question, what frameworks have the least overlap/utility.",

All of these mean there are a minimum set of standards that have to be met and if CSPs are to provide services to the federal government, so will they. Unless there is a change in federal law and the approach the executive branch has towards securing government systems, this is a tough place to be.\r\n\r\nI believe a conjunction of the various WG efforts are what will be necessary to answer the framework approach.  The automated assessments and reporting will go a long way in validating implementation, reducing burdens on CSPs and increasing visibility. Pair this with the updates to con mon and continuous reporting, can potentially define what that FedRAMP 20x baseline will be and bring some parity to the commercial and government environments.",

What is easier for the business while maintaining a secure posture for Federal agencies.  To me, that would remove SOC 2+ from the mix.  Using something like CIS, PCI DSS, or ISO 27001 makes it quick for those orgs to understand and implement.  The community support is already there and new audit procedures are not needed.  \r\n\r\n\"FedRAMP X\" gives us that chance to revolutionize how we think about Federal compliance and send a strong message to frameworks like SOC 2 that change is needed.  I've advocated for a replacement of SOC 2 for a long time.  It has just become a token framework; it doesn't even call itself a certification.\r\n\r\nI may be seen as picking on SOC 2, but trust me, there are other frameworks out there that match its lack of controls.  Those can be inserted here as well.  \r\n\r\nDare I say it but maybe \"FedRAMP X\" goes the CMMC path and just chooses SP800-171 as the core?

There is also the gap analysis that should be conducted so this automated mapping either ignores that or additionally extends the scope. I am not saying that automated mapping of other frameworks isn't a cool or good idea, but I am far more interested in a standardized machine-readable security plan and all of the benefits that it would enable.

          "body": "@osteth , I strongly disagree with your position. Here's why:\r\n1. control mapping is not really that technically complex. We do it all the time. It is a hallmark of many GRC tools already. \r\n2. as @ryantpatrick pointed out, there are already existing, published mappings out there. Some of them are even on the NIST website. \r\n3. As I interpret the intent regarding reuse from @pete-gov 's presentation to CSPs, it is meant to allow CSPs to reuse the investment that they have already put into commercial security certifications, many of which are required by other industry customers, in order to speed FedRAMP achievement and potentially decrease overall cost to achieve (which is empowering to small businesses and startups). (don't mean to put words in Pete's mouth, so tagged here to clarify if this is not the intent).\r\n4. WHEN we move to an automated authorization model, it will be straightforward to reuse test data between frameworks, too. \r\n\r\nThere are some challenges to reciprocity between frameworks, that is true, but I do not see any of these challenges as insurmountable. \r\n-Scope of assessment. A commercial control could only be reused if indeed the commercial system scope and the federal system scope were the same. This is unlikely for any FedRAMP High authorization (hello, GovCloud), but is certainly possible at the FR Moderate level, and I would argue even likely at the FedRAMP Low level. \r\n-Control granularity. The 800-53 has so much granularity at the control level that commercial framework controls often cover more than one 800-53 control. This can make mapping a little bit messy, especially if you are new to the 800-53.  I think that commercial certifications, and this is a generalization, speak more to the \"key security indicators\" that have been brought up as part of FR 20X.\r\n-auditor certification. FedRAMP would need to agree that certified auditors who created certified audit reports for ISO 27001, 27017, 27018, SOC 2 Type 2, IRAP, PCI DSS 4.0, etc. can be 'accepted', and that there is no hang up on \"the work was not completed by a FedRAMP auditor\".

          "body": "@au-der, I appreciate your take on this. Please allow me to offer some counterpoints: \r\nMapping Controls manually is time-consuming but not technically complex. when we enter the world of automation the complexity goes up exponentially. Let's look at an in my experience fairly standard CSP entering into FedRAMP for the first time who has ISO27001 and SOC2 building their FedRAMP security plan for the first time. They have their SOC2 and ISO27001 controls documents in a .docx file so first we need a method to take in these two documents that are not well constructed to be read by a machine and parse those documents. there is an infinite number of ways they could have formatted that document and we now have to write code that guesses what their formatting is and interpolate that into some standard let's use OSCAL for example because that makes sense here. \r\n\r\nNow we can get into mapping. You are correct this is an understood space within commercial GRC products, few resources are available under an open-source license or in the public domain so we either have to replicate that effort or pay some company to license for their mappings (essentially picking someone to win the competitive GRC landscape).  This isn't a thing that can't be overcome it's just extra effort. Tx-Ramp, GovRamp, CMMC, FedRAMP, NIST 800-171, NIST CSF, and CJIS are all subsets of NIST 800-53 so I take no issue with accepting these frameworks. I just think there is more value in producing and publishing a working standard as an example and allowing the market to fill in the gaps.\r\n\r\nSOC2 on the other hand does not have a baseline requirement like FedRAMP does. So instead of assessors assuring that a CSP has achieved any standard, they are assuring that the CSP is being honest about what they have stated they do. While the controls can be mapped there is no assurance of security. \r\n\r\nI have never experienced an issue when submitting a FedRAMP security plan to my SOC2 assessor so I feel that reciprocity already exists. but I would see bi-directional reciprocity for frameworks that are not a subset of NIST 800-53 to be a mistake. \r\n\r\nFinally, Why does FedRAMP have to be everything for everyone? Automation, as you correctly pointed out, will enable data reuse. We should let FedRAMP be great at being FedRAMP. ",

I imagine in many cases, the same firm performed a SOC 2 and FedRAMP audit, so trust is inherently there, but when its not the same firm, the 3PAO should have to make a determination on whether they will rely on the SOC 2 Type 2 report. In addition, the 3PAO would have to confirm the scope covered by the SOC 2 Type 2 report aligned with the FedRAMP scope. I would also think the 3PAO would want to make a determination based on timing. If the audit period covered by the SOC 2 Type 2 report is from nine months ago, they may not want to rely on the report.",
