      "body": "This is the official mapping document you can download from the AICPA's website if you are a member. This maps the NIST 800-53 r5 to the SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria. I understand this isn't mapped to the FedRAMP controls and baselines, but the point here is that because the controls aren't defined, organizations that are already undergoing SOC 2 and FedRAMP would be able to use the FedRAMP controls and reference the FedRAMP controls by control ID within the SOC 2 report by mapping them to Trust Services Criteria. If FedRAMP works with the AICPA, they can create an official mapping that CPA firms could use. I understand there are other hurdles that need to be overcome in terms of qualification of auditors and ensuring the scope of the SOC 2 audit would need to cover the appropriate system for FedRAMP, but this is true with any commercial framework. I do think it would be very easy to see the FedRAMP controls that were tested in a SOC 2 report and the results of that testing if the issued SOC 2 report referenced the FedRAMP control IDs. \r\n\r\n[tsc_to_nist_800-53.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19686716/tsc_to_nist_800-53.xlsx)\r\n\r\n",
