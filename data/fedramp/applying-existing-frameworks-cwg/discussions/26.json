  "title": "Why not NIST 800-171?",
  "body": "We can de-scope 2/3 of the excess controls in FedRAMP Moderate by making it based on 800-171 like CMMC.  What is that? about 80% of the authorizations?   Tremendous efficiency without compromising security or breaking any (FISMA) laws or regulations.  And less onerous requirements around documentation is a plus!\r\n\r\nNIST 800-171 is the standard for \"non-federal information systems\" that store, process or transport federal data.  I would argue that is exactly what a commercial cloud service is.\r\n\r\nNIST 800-53 is the standard for federal information systems.  Created when most were on prem, which imho is why so many of the controls don't make sense for cloud.  \r\n\r\nI am good with High systems being based on 800-53.  However, if the minimum requirement for handling CUI is NIST 800-171, but for cloud systems it needs to be FedRAMP Moderate (according to the FAR), then why does FedRAMP Moderate need to be based on 800-53? Seems inconsistent to me.",

      "body": "I think the challenge with NIST 800-171 is that it primarily focuses on confidentiality. Its core objective is to protect CUI from unauthorized disclosure when processed, stored, or transmitted in non-federal systems and organizations. It doesn't do well to cover integrity and, more importantly in the context of a CSP, the availability of data. \n\nWith that said, I think the FedRAMP PMO is exploring all options. ",

          "body": "I feel like \"availability\" of a commercial cloud service is more of an SLA thing.  Does the government **_really_** care about a CSPs contingency planning, maintenance, media protection, and physical security, etc. other than the 800-171 requirements in those families?  And yes, if there is an overlay needed for some 800-53 control that an agency feels is super important that needs to be included, it can still include it.  As I look at 800-53 with a new lens though, it really does seem redundant and superfluous, at least for the 80% solution, where 800-171 probably gets the job done. For the other 20%, sure, you can go FedRAMP High / NIST 800-53.",

          "body": "I feel the government does have a reason to care about more than just SLAs. A CSP can roll the dice that their primary datacenter will never go down, and be right most of the time and meet their SLA. But if it ever is down due to a major catastrophe, the CSP puts the government customer at risk if they can't recover their system within the SLAs. In my eyes this is about the government making the call on risk mitigation and risk acceptance. Maybe there's room to let different agencies with different systems and requirements set different bars, but then we're complicating things even more..",

If FedRAMP were more based on the CMMC controls there would likely still be a differences between the two but CSPs could likely get both authorizations on one system without any sort of herculean effort. FedRAMP could tailor in some 800-53 controls or specific parameters but that wouldn't necessitate an entirely different FedRAMP authorized system like many CSPs need to do currently. ",

As an example, we do have an internal network that we have had CMMC L2 3PAO certified (mapped to 800-171) to process US CUI data and strictly control access--but it is not a cloud service that we sell to any customers--it is for our internal business operations.   \r\n\r\nFor CSPs & FedRAMP customers to benefit from applying existing frameworks, we need to be able to share the evidence across **current** frameworks that we already perform in the commercial space.
