What are typically timeframes for commercial frameworks, 6mo, 12mo, etc?

How common are bridge letters or other reoccurring addendums to past reports?

For HITRUST, we have two 12-month certifications and one 24-month certification (which includes an interim assessment at the 12-month mark which extends the cert another year; if the interim is not completed the certification is revoked). 

Bridge letters are available for HITRUST but by exception only (approvals come from the HITRUST Quality Officer) and requires testing of elements of the original scope (by a third-party assessor), submission to HITRUST, and has 6 levels of QA run on it before the letter is issued. Typically, the bridge letter will only extend the certification for an additional 30-60 days.

@ryantpatrick, this is great feedback.  Could you share how many CSPs currently have  HITRUST certifications?

I'd have to dig for that specific info but most the HITRUST certified environments have a cloud component to them. Many of the largest CSPs have HT certification and are a part of our shared responsibilities program where their customers can directly inherit (automated) from the CSP for the controls that the CSP manages on their behalf. It reduces redundancy and increases the efficiency of the assessment process.

Here is AWS list and HITRUST is one of the certifications:   https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/

ISO has a 3 year cycle: 1st year certification, 2nd & 3rd years surveillance. After the 3 year cycle they re-certify and begin again. Certification is a 2 stage process and the time frame depends on the company size.

Hello, FedRAMP friend and colleague. One thought of mine is that artifact timeframe is a super complicated and contextually deep topic that humans understand very well, but is pretty hard to explain to machines. One way some colleagues that volunteer in another standards group addressed this was to [transition away from framing it as only as a measure of time, but talk about freshness instead](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9334.html#name-freshness). Age/time matter for some artifacts in when they are made, processed, or accessed, others there are different ways since "recent" or "not stale" can be hard to simplify. Not sure that explanation is helpful or useful, but something I wanted to explore in our CWG eventually as well. Would love to discuss more in this thread if you think that's helpful or not.

SOC2 is a 12 month testing period, with the assessment occurring annually. I don't believe other certs have the stringent continuous monitoring requirements - we do the certs then hear from the assessors in a year. Customers may ask for follow-up on items identified in the reports, but overall its an annual exercise.  We've done bridge letters when there was a gap in time between the testing periods for a SOC2 - for example when we sold off part of the company, there was a gap of a couple months between when the last SOC2 was done and the current one started.
