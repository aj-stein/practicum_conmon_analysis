# Post

For CSPs who already hold an active ATO from the federal agency and work closely with a 3PAO, what best practices would you recommend for preparing machine-readable evidence packages and aligning with the proposed Key Security Indicators (KSIs)? Are there common pitfalls to avoid when transitioning from agency ATO documentation to this new approach?
