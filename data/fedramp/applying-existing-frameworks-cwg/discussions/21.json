          "body": "Both. The firm obviously should be qualified (trained, educated, experienced, authorized) to conduct the audit but there should also be specific standards in which an acceptable commercial framework/standard assessment or audit is conducted (testing, sampling, scoring, scoping, etc). For example, a sample size of one in a population size of 1000 is inadequate and doesn't provide confidence that the control is fully implemented, scaled, or mature. There should also be quality control layered on top of each audit to ensure that it was conducted against the established standard. This removes inconsistencies and standardizes the output of the assessment.",
