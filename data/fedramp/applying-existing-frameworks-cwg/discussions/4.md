Larry Hughes (VP of R&D) from Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) here. CSA works with some 15,000 global volunteers to define and raise awareness of best practices for cloud security. We believe that our STAR program (Security Trust Assurance and Risk) and Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM), which have played an proven role in the cloud security ecosystem since 2013, can play an important role in FedRAMP 20x.

Tom Cornelius from the Secure Controls Framework (SCF). We currently have the low, moderate, high and LI-SaaS baselines from FedRAMP R4 & R5 mapped into the SCF, so we look forward to seeing how the SCF can be applied to FedRAMP. The SCF leverages Set Theory Relationship Mapping (STRM) from NIST IR 8477 to conduct the crosswalk mappings and that is free to download from the SCF website.

Bernie Leung representing myself. Been putting together FedRAMP and FISMA systems for over 10 years. Sentiment in public is that FedRAMP is tough, which it is. But there are certainly ways to speed it up. Very happy to see this FedRAMP 20X effort, as I can always use authorized 3rd party SaaS in my systems.
