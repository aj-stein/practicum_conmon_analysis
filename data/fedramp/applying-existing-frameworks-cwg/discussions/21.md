I think we should discuss minimum assurance methodologies and quality methodologies. Not at all private or commercial frameworks have specified assurance standards, we should discuss the minimum requirements that FR20x would be willing to consider/accept.

Please help me better understand specified assurance standards. 

Does this apply to the process or methodology of HOW a service is audited or does this more involve WHO is performing the assessment and if/how they or their organization is deemed certified/qualified?

Both. The firm obviously should be qualified (trained, educated, experienced, authorized) to conduct the audit but there should also be specific standards in which an acceptable commercial framework/standard assessment or audit is conducted (testing, sampling, scoring, scoping, etc). For example, a sample size of one in a population size of 1000 is inadequate and doesn't provide confidence that the control is fully implemented, scaled, or mature. There should also be quality control layered on top of each audit to ensure that it was conducted against the established standard. This removes inconsistencies and standardizes the output of the assessment.

Along the same idea to add to the meeting discussion, I refer to my posts from here: https://github.com/FedRAMP/applying-existing-frameworks-cwg/discussions/5#discussioncomment-12750884

@emu-gov Hello, is it possible to upload to this forum, the slides for the discussions? Preferably before the meetings?
