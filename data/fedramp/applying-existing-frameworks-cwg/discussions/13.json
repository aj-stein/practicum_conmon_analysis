  "body": "We have a customer that began the whole authorization process about a year ago and are finally at a point where they have a recommendation for authorization and are unsure about what next steps will be.  We do not want to provide incorrect guidance however my thoughts are that they would now submit their SAR to their sponsoring agency for its blessing and authorization to operate.  Once that is received would they then submit their signed authorization letter to FedRAMP to officially move their FedRAMP Marketplace status to Approved from In Progress?  This would be a FedRAMP 800-53 Rev 5 Moderate system.",
