# Post

The FedRAMP 20x [Phase One Pilot](https://www.fedramp.gov/20x/phase-one/) will be kicking off shortly. A Request for Comment (RFC-0006) has been published for a draft standard on [Key Security Indicators (KSIs)](https://www.fedramp.gov/rfcs/0006/), if you have feedback, please check out the [RFC-0006 thread](https://github.com/FedRAMP/rfcs/discussions/18).

@pete-gov will be discussing the Pilot and answering questions on tomorrow’s (30 Apr) Automating Assessments CWG townhall - [meeting registration](https://gsa.zoomgov.com/meeting/register/FpW3sJuBRxag_1Mz49J0Cw).

As part of the pilot, we will be evaluating if any existing SOC 2 Type 2 documentation can be leveraged for validating KSIs. 
- *Please note we are not establishing full reciprocity, only evaluating if existing documentation can be used as validation evidence.*

What documentation in SOC 2 report can be used to satisfy the  [Key Security Indicators (KSIs)](https://www.fedramp.gov/rfcs/0006/)?  We are looking for reuse of existing materials and not applying a mapping or reciprocity approach.

I don’t believe you will be able to rely on a SOC 2 report or any other commercial framework’s report without doing a mapping to KSIs (unless I am misunderstanding what is meant by mapping). Section 4 of a SOC 2 Type 2 report will have all the controls and the results of an auditor’s testing for each control. This could be used, but a mapping would have to be done manually or with AI to determine which controls satisfy a KSI. 

As mentioned in other threads, the scope of a SOC 2 Type 2 audit (or any other commercial framework audit) would have to be validated to ensure it covered the same infrastructure, software, people and data in scope for the federal environment. I don’t think that can be validated just by looking at a report.
