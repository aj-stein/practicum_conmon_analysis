  "body": "## Overview\r\nThis project is developing an open-source framework for automating FedRAMP assessments using:\r\n- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)\r\n- Policy-as-Code\r\n- OSCAL-based machine-readable reporting\r\n- DevSecOps and CI/CD pipeline integration\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Goals of This Working Group\r\n\r\nForming an implementation-focused community around three outcomes:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 1. Define Key Security Indicators (KSIs)\r\n\r\n**KSIs are measurable, automatable translations of traditional FedRAMP/NIST controls.**\r\n\r\n#### Example KSIs:\r\n\r\n# \ud83d\udcca Key Security Indicators (KSIs) - FedRAMP 20x\r\n\r\nThis table provides a set of measurable and automatable Key Security Indicators (KSIs) that map directly to NIST 800-53 controls, reflecting the FedRAMP 20x goal of continuous, configuration-based compliance.\r\n\r\n| KSI ID   | Description                                                     | Mapped Control(s)                           | Frequency   | Evidence Source                                |\r\n|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------|\r\n| KSI-001  | FIPS-validated encryption enabled                               | AC-17(2), SC-12, SC-13, SC-28, SC-28(1)     | Continuous  | Terraform plan, AWS API                       |\r\n| KSI-002  | MFA enabled for all users                                       | IA-2(1), IA-2(2), IA-5(1)                   | Daily       | IAM policy scan, AWS CLI                      |\r\n| KSI-003  | TLS 1.3 enforced on external endpoints                          | SC-08, SC-13                                | Continuous  | ALB listener, GCP/Azure configs               |\r\n| KSI-004  | Encryption at rest (S3/RDS/Blob/Disks)                          | SC-28, SC-28(1)                             | Continuous  | Terraform config, cloud API                   |\r\n| KSI-005  | IAM users must rotate access keys within 90 days                | IA-5(1), AC-2                               | Daily       | AWS IAM Credential Report                     |\r\n| KSI-006  | No default security groups allow inbound 0.0.0.0/0              | AC-4, SC-7                                  | Continuous  | Security group scan, Terraform config         |\r\n| KSI-007  | Only approved AMIs/images are used in EC2/VM deployments        | CM-6, CM-8, SI-7                            | Continuous  | EC2 image audit, Terraform module reference   |\r\n| KSI-008  | Logging enabled for all cloud storage and compute resources     | AU-2, AU-6, AU-12, SI-4                     | Continuous  | CloudTrail, GCP Audit Logs, Azure Monitor     |\r\n| KSI-009  | Backups are scheduled and encrypted                             | CP-9, CP-10, SC-28, SC-28(1)                | Daily       | Cloud backup config, Terraform state          |\r\n| KSI-010  | Root account login is disabled or protected by MFA              | AC-2, IA-2(1), IA-2(2)                      | Continuous  | IAM credential report, AWS config             |\r\n| KSI-011  | Containers must not run as root                                 | AC-6(10), CM-6, SI-7                        | Continuous  | Kubernetes policy, OPA, container scanner     |\r\n| KSI-012  | EBS volumes and Azure disks are encrypted by default            | SC-12, SC-28                                | Continuous  | Cloud config API, IaC                         |\r\n| KSI-013  | Ports and protocols restricted to minimum necessary             | SC-7, AC-4, CM-7                            | Continuous  | Network ACLs, firewall policy, Terraform plan |\r\n| KSI-014  | All user accounts mapped to active identity providers (SSO)     | AC-2, IA-4, IA-5                            | Weekly      | SSO sync audit, Identity Provider logs        |\r\n| KSI-015  | OS baseline hardening policies applied via automation           | CM-6, CM-7, SI-2, SI-7                      | Continuous  | Ansible playbooks, STIG scripts, agent logs   |\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What We'll Do:\r\n- Define a growing set of KSIs mapped to NIST 800-53 Rev5.\r\n- Write implementation guidance for each KSI.\r\n- Define frequency, automation method, and evidence format.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2. Create a Machine-Readable KSI Schema\r\n\r\nThis schema will express KSIs in a YAML/JSON format for automation tooling.\r\n\r\n#### Example `ksis.yaml`:\r\n```yaml\r\nksis:\r\n  - id: \"KSI-001\"\r\n    name: \"FIPS Encryption\"\r\n    controlMapping: [\"SC-12\", \"SC-13\"]\r\n    frequency: \"Continuous\"\r\n    evidenceType: \"Terraform/Cloud API\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Usage:\r\n- Enables shared interpretation of controls across systems\r\n- Drives consistent reporting and tooling\r\n- Can be mapped to OSCAL components\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3. Build a Machine-Readable Output Format (Validation Results)\r\n\r\nThese are the **responses to the KSIs** \u2014 the actual assessment outcomes.\r\n\r\n#### Example `validation.json`:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"KSI-001\": {\r\n    \"status\": \"passed\",\r\n    \"evidence\": \"aws_kms_key config meets FIPS\",\r\n    \"timestamp\": \"2025-03-31T10:00:00Z\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"KSI-002\": {\r\n    \"status\": \"failed\",\r\n    \"evidence\": \"user123 missing MFA\",\r\n    \"timestamp\": \"2025-03-31T10:00:01Z\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis structure allows:\r\n- Integration with dashboards and reporting tools\r\n- Continuous evidence collection\r\n- OSCAL SSP generation\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\nWe are already implementing this with:\r\n\r\n### Infrastructure as Code\r\n- Terraform modules for AWS, Azure, and GCP\r\n- Example: `terraform/aws/kms.tf` checks FIPS via resource config\r\n\r\n### Policy as Code (OPA/Rego)\r\n- Rego rules validate runtime posture (TLS version, MFA enabled, etc.)\r\n- Output is evaluated inside pipelines or live environments\r\n\r\n### CI/CD Integration (GitHub Actions)\r\n- Run Terraform validation on push\r\n- Execute Rego and Python checks against cloud APIs\r\n- Build React dashboard and generate OSCAL output\r\n\r\n### Evidence Format\r\n- OSCAL JSON/YAML output for compliance audits\r\n- JSON/Markdown summaries for dashboards and documentation\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##  Example: FIPS KSI in Action\r\n\r\n**Control:** SC-12., SC-13  \r\n**Check:** KMS key uses SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT with rotation enabled  \r\n**IaC:** Terraform plan  \r\n**OPA:** `input.fips_encryption_enabled == true`  \r\n**Output:** validation result stored in JSON + OSCAL\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## How You Can Contribute/Work to be done\r\n\r\n- Help define and validate KSIs\r\n- Contribute Terraform or Rego examples\r\n- Test pipelines across AWS, Azure, GCP\r\n- Build dashboards or evidence exports\r\n- Map controls to OSCAL SSP components\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Questions for the Community\r\n\r\n- What other KSIs should we prioritize?\r\n- How should we structure evidence across cloud providers?\r\n- Should we bundle validation into a CLI tool or GitHub Action?\r\n- Should results feed into dashboards or SSP exports?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n",

It would be good to get them onboard with this and the ConMon group.\r\n> GovReady-Q: An open-source GRC platform for highly automated, user-friendly compliance assessments and documentation, suitable for DevSecOps.\r\n\r\nWith [FedRAMP hat off](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-dusseault-consensus-00#autoid-10) (advocate from one of the CWGs, personal opinions my own), I had tried to contribute to this one open source project over the years. After the staff moved from GovReady company to Regscale as part of acquisition, it appears it is no longer maintained. The last activity was 4 months or so ago and then it was just minor touchups. After December 2024, activity appears to have stopped and technically EOLed in 2023 per https://github.com/GovReady/govready-q/issues/1799#issuecomment-1508525550.\r\n\r\nAs someone who dabbles in OSCAL (if I can be cute about that in the forum, I am one of the FedRAMP OSCAL people and a community contributors to the models and tools for some time \ud83d\udc4b ), I have evaluated those with OSCAL import/export support in spare time over the years. To varying degrees there are some real challenges to scaling complex, multi-faceted assessment participants in this WG need but, from CLI tools to full end-user applications, fall short in real-world use cases. Existing community-maintained projects and commercial solutions benefit from experiences and approaches from this WG. One person gave a great example I have seen with all tools I tested:\r\n\r\n> @Christcpd - thanks for the references, we have checked all of these mechanisms out and unfortunately these don't currently have the capability for FedRAMP or NIST 800-53 based assessments. They may cover the base control IDs, but do not cover the NIST 800-53A assessment procedures (APs), as one control ID could be multiple APs\r\n\r\nSo what most excites me about these CWGs is the opportunity to breath new life into the existing solutions and give life to new ones, community, commercial, or hybrid. Real-world deployment for GRC solutions is rarely one-size-fits-all, and there is probably much room for improvement in FedRAMP assessment, present and future. It is a very complex beast. So I hope to see what changes _you all think industry needs_ in existing solutions, or new ones altogether. Just my $0.02.",

          "body": "@Christcpd  / @rgutwein   I am thinking we start simple and gradually build.   I feel that as a north star or primary mission, we should focus on what small to medium size businesses need in order to get started with FedRAMP with minimal investment.   This would address I feel one of the biggest problems which is the high cost for entry for FedRAMP.   Large business and hyperscalers have plenty of people to develop something custom or plenty of budget to buy all the latest tools.   However, for small to medium size businesses, there is no simple open source way to get started.  \r\n\r\nFedRAMP is different than many traditional compliance programs in that your customers (the agencies) are required to review your security posture every month which starts with your full inventory and includes details of your vulnerability management and in recent years, hardening.   Typical GRC tools are not geared for this and are usually very inadequate.\r\n\r\nGetting ready to expose that level of detail to your customers about your security operations every month to me is the primary challenge with FedRAMP.   Most other compliance programs, you can show the auditor one clean report, check the box and not have to worry about it for a year.   FedRAMP is not a check-the-box compliance program but requires you to prove every month that you are managing your security risks within the required parameters.\r\n\r\nMake sense?   \r\n\r\nTo make it easy, I think the simplest place to start is with a solid inventory in FedRAMP accepted format.   There was [one project by AWS that produced something close](https://github.com/aws-samples/fedramp-integrated-inventory-workbook), but it has not been updated in awhile, but might be a good project to build on.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I wholeheartedly agree that we should focus on lowering that barrier to entry. A starter project with a solid inventory of KSIs, IaC patterns, and policy-as-code is a great way to enable immediate value. We're already working on templates for Terraform, OPA, and OSCAL with GitHub Actions to produce machine-readable evidence: https://github.com/rgutwein/fedramp-ksi-validation\r\n\r\nI'm also aligned with the idea that we need to coordinate across working groups.

The attacks always go after the weakest link.  So when I hear that - I say - if the data at risk is low risk - great, adjust the threat model and risk tolerance accordingly.

That may seem like a lot - but really - not since most of them are using the same structure.  Now the CSO itself needs to expose more APIs/telemetry. We often see that as the problem.  Azure and AWS etc all have great and granular APIs and logging. CSOs do not.  Ever asked your CSO for the audit logs or SIEM integration?

          "body": "@JBockmann \u2014 your points are well taken. KSI-001 is a great example of how automation gets complicated fast when we move beyond the core IaaS layer. Many offerings use components and connection managers that aren\u2019t tied to AWS, and validating those, especially for FedRAMP equivalency, still requires traditional control mapping, documentation, and often policy review. Even if some telemetry exists, it\u2019s not always structured, signed, or complete enough to serve as standalone evidence.\n\n@sunstonesecure-robert \u2014 I think we\u2019re all aligned in wanting to push the envelope with automation. IaC testing, cryptographic log chaining, and CNCF-backed threat simulations are great ideas in theory. But in practice, CSPs often struggle to:\n\n- Prove parity between test IaC and production environments (drift detection is still nascent, even in tools like Terraform Cloud).\n- Get meaningful telemetry out of CSOs, especially those that weren\u2019t built with observability or policy-as-code in mind.\n- Convince agencies and 3PAOs that signed logs or hashed evidence chains meet FedRAMP \u201cobjectivity\u201d thresholds without independent verification.\n\nEven assuming we have 3,000 tests across AWS, GCP, and Azure, that doesn\u2019t solve for enterprise systems using legacy integrations, on-prem CMs, or unmanaged SaaS interdependencies. And it doesn\u2019t fully answer how we\u2019d automate control families like AT, PL, or IR, where qualitative evidence is still dominant.\n\nSo while I\u2019m supportive of open-sourcing these automation frameworks through CNCF, we\u2019ll need to be realistic:\n\n- Many KSIs will still require attestation or \u201csemi-automated\u201d evidence.\n- The cost-benefit of building telemetry pipelines across every control family isn\u2019t uniform.\n- Agencies and 3PAOs need to be part of this conversation early, otherwise, we risk building a technically elegant solution that isn\u2019t operationally accepted.\n\nI\u2019m in favor of mapping each control to a tiered assurance model:\n- Tier 1: Direct evidence through CSP-native APIs or logs.\n- Tier 2: Evidence derived from CSO telemetry with signed attestations.\n- Tier 3: Requires traditional assessment or 3PAO judgment.\n\nThat helps us be honest about what\u2019s possible today, while still charting a roadmap for tomorrow.\n",
