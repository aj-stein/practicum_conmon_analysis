We want to participate in the pilot, but we do not go through the SOC2 assessment. We do undergo CMMI and 27000 assessments. Can we still participate in the pilot?

The pilot is open entirely to the public and anyone can participate. See [the Who should participate? section of the Phase One pilot page](https://www.fedramp.gov/20x/phase-one/) for more details.

Join the CNCF OSCAL Compass WG! We are morphing OSCAL from a NIST 800-53 focus into what it needs to be to be the compliance expression language for industry!
