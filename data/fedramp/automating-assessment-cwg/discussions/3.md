This is a forum to discuss topics related to FedRAMP Automating Assessment Community Working Group. 

The FedRAMP PMO will regularly post questions and discussion prompts with the label "FedRAMP Discussion Starters" to spark engagement and gather input from industry on topics of interest, where you are encouraged to engage directly with us. However, this community is meant to be community-driven, and as such, members of our community are encouraged to post their own discussion threads, share their own thoughts and ideas, and contribute in whatever way they see fit. However you decide to engage, the information you post here will be taken into consideration as FedRAMP develops FedRAMP 20x.

Hello all! I'm Tara Houlden, currently the Director of Compliance at Red Hat. We're an Open Source Software company. I previously worked for the DON in various ISSM, validator, and AODR roles for about a decade. I'm excited about the opportunity in front of us to automate compliance in general, not just for FedRAMP.  If we think about this Automation working group and the Frameworks working group together, then a way to ensure reuse of commercial efforts for our products would be through security compliance automation that is fully interoperable across frameworks, regions, CSPs. 

There is a small cadre of folks that have already started this work under a project at CNCF called OSCAL Compass. I hope many of you will check it out!  https://clomonitor.io/projects/cncf/oscal-compass

Larry Hughes (VP of R&D) from Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) here. CSA works with some 15,000 global volunteers to define and raise awareness of best practices for cloud security. We believe that our STAR program (Security Trust Assurance and Risk) and Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM), which have played an proven role in the cloud security ecosystem since 2013, can play an important role in FedRAMP 20x.

Hi, I'm Scott Hoopes with Moss Adams. I've been doing FedRAMP assessments for the past five or six years, including a good handful of useful automation in reporting and audit preparation on the auditor side. Interested in seeing where automation comes into play on the CSP side!

Hi -- John Sammarco from Definitive Business Solutions, Inc. here. We are headquartered in Reston VA. We plan to participate in the pilot. We have a SaaS offering called “Definitive Pro®”, which helps customers develop business cases, prioritize projects, and optimize spend. Definitive Pro® offers a full lifecycle service that integrates advanced decision-making, data analysis, human judgment, and cutting-edge Gen AI capabilities. It's hosted within Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has received Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) approval at the “Moderate” level. We expect to leverage our SOC 2 Type II, an agency ATO, and our continuous monitoring system (Vanta) to prepare our machine-readable file. We are looking forward to the future sessions!
