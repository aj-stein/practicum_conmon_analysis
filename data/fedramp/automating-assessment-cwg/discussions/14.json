  "title": "What if Boundary Diagrams could be automated?",
  "body": "Most CSP's spend a large percentage of overall FedRAMP authorization time creating and perfecting the Boundary Diagram. From the initial creation to the back/forth with the 3PAO to the back/forth with FedRAMP to the updates needed with every change, the amount of time that needs to be spent just keeping the Boundary Diagram up to date is enormous. Given that the inventory and network layout for a CSP's Cloud Service Offering is fully available through the Cloud Provider's API, how much time do CSP's think could be saved if there was an open source tool available that could:\r\n\r\n- Create a basic boundary diagram using the cloud provider API\r\n- Add in a depiction of any external dependencies using the data in Table 7.1 of the SSP\r\n- Automatically include depiction of remote access based on your choice of the most common reference architectures for secure FedRAMP authorizable remote access to cloud infrastructure (there are not more than a handful of choices with each major cloud provider)\r\n- Allow you to select from common reference architectures for depicting customer interaction with your product or create your own (e.g. agent installed on premise talks to services in boundary, customer and/or admin web page presented by services running in boundary) \r\n- Allow you to customize the diagram for any special use cases\r\n\r\n\r\n",

One of the challenges I have observed from machine-generated diagrams (fun fact, we can generate _a lot of stuff_ with metaschema-framework tooling by introspecting OSCAL and this underlying Metaschema DSL, it is a pretty indicative example of the struggle) is the sheer immensity of the data and how to organize and filter it, all while making it programmatically accessible. It is an apple to oranges to comparison, except in the number of items will be an order of magnitude larger with a realistic production CSP deployment. So my parenthetical comment, we can generate a giant Mermaid diagram for the whole OSCAL data model and it is sooo teensy tiny from the number of data points and it nearly hangs mermaid.live.  Are you using this approach for your current system that is sizable? Do you have shared experiences like I describe, or is your experience entirely different?",

One benefit of the boundary diagram is it's useful for internal team members who don't need all the details in the SSP but are necessary to consult for decision making. For example: GRC/FedRAMP team talking with DevOps/IT team to make architecture choices. The diagram (if kept high-level) is more approachable for technical but non-GRC team members who need to be aware of how the FedRAMP offering is architected. From the GRC/FedRAMP side, the boundary adds value by making those internal conversations easier. ",

If we can create that as a structure, I think that we can then do two things.  Have CSPs create their diagrams as Mermaid/XML which would allow 2 things (using a standard template):\r\na- actual ability to create standardized diagrams from a known good state that should all look the same\r\nb- allow for an automated review of the 'diagram' by parsing the XML.

In my 3PAO days, all FedRAMP review sessions (RARs and SARs) easily spent at least half of the session focused on deep dives into the diagrams.  I've also seen multiple cycles of the same diagrams!  First there is the back and forth on the RAR diagrams.  And then 6 months to a year later, when we submitted the full SAR with essentially the same diagram, we went through the same diagram deep dive again, with even more iterations.  And I get it; the ABD serves as a a pictoral summary of essentially a 400+ page SSP, and all parties wanted a detailed critical analysis of the system and that took the form of the ABD review.  \r\n\r\nBut yeah, I completely agree with your take.  Maybe we should revert back to first principles and say 'what are we trying to accomplish with a given artifact?'  Not to side track too much on the old RARs, but at one point, it was supposed to be a 2 or so week snapshot of the overall maturity of a system as an indicator of how ready they were to pursue FedRAMP.  Over the years, we had massive scope creep and RARs went from 'FedRAMP Ready' to essentially 'FedRAMP Perfect' with a really high threshold and zero tolerance for any risk acceptance whatsoever.   \r\n \r\n",

We've been taught to expect certain things from these diagrams and as recently as the last year been asked to provide even **more** detail to them. The way I view diagrams, especially an ABD that crosses AWS and GCP and has dozens of products involved in it is a starting point for a conversation.

That's the dream IMO. As an SRE my approach would be to look at the diagram to where where Box X connects then immediately dive into the detailed configuration and inventory information around Box X to understand what it's doing - rather than expect all of that information to be on a diagram.",
