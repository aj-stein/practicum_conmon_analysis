I previously worked for the DON in various ISSM, validator, and AODR roles for about a decade. I'm excited about the opportunity in front of us to automate compliance in general, not just for FedRAMP.  If we think about this Automation working group and the Frameworks working group together, then a way to ensure reuse of commercial efforts for our products would be through security compliance automation that is fully interoperable across frameworks, regions, CSPs. \r\n\r\nThere is a small cadre of folks that have already started this work under a project at CNCF called OSCAL Compass.

We have a SaaS offering called \u201cDefinitive Pro\u00ae\u201d, which helps customers develop business cases, prioritize projects, and optimize spend. Definitive Pro\u00ae offers a full lifecycle service that integrates advanced decision-making, data analysis, human judgment, and cutting-edge Gen AI capabilities. It's hosted within Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has received Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) approval at the \u201cModerate\u201d level. We expect to leverage our SOC 2 Type II, an agency ATO, and our continuous monitoring system (Vanta) to prepare our machine-readable file. We are looking forward to the future sessions!",
