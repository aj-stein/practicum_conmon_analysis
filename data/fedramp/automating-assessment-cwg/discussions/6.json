We could have done some super sweet stuff with more real-world OSCAL demos back in the day had I known I could have set this up. Ironically, last time I saw it was ~4 years ago when I used it for LFCS Linux and Kubernetes exams. I loved the hands on teaching keyboard method, I am glad that has evolved so nicely. Looking forward to playing with this iximiuz stuff as well.\r\n\r\nThanks again, and back to our scheduled programming on the showcase. \ud83d\ude04 ",

      "body": "AWS Has multiple services that can support this. AWS Config records configurations for AWS resources used in an environment and creates new snapshots each time a change is made to a resource. Further it can process rules against those configuration items (CIs) to indicate whether or not any resource configuration is or is not in compliance with a specific rule. Those rules can be aligned to KSIs. For the reporting aspect, AWS Audit Manager can collect the state of the rules continuously and report on them. Some solutioning will need to take place on the format, target and cadence. AWS Control Tower and orchestrate an environment in AWS that has a wide variety of detective, corrective and proactive controls that can be tailored to align with FedRAMP KSIs as they emerge. Will there be an opportunity to demonstrate these capabilities?",
