      "body": "@kyhu65867 and team,  I think many CSPs spend a lot of time perfecting the boundary diagram and making sure it aligns perfectly with the SSP and inventory.   There is a lot of time spent iterating back and forth between CSP and 3PAO and then with the FedRAMP PMO until the diagram is acceptable.   For us, this time alone added over a month and a half to the overall process due to all the many written requirements and often subjective unwritten requirements for the diagram.   \n\nIs this something we might be able to talk about addressing using technology such as cloud diagramming automation in this group or is that not in consideration ?",

One of the goals of this space is to identify modern, innovative methods for assessment that aren't as manually intensive. I would recommend opening a new discussion thread to talk specifically about this as I am sure it is of interest to a number of participants here!",

          "body": "Thanks Kylie, I will open a new thread.  I would be curious the percentage of overall review time spent addressing boundary diagram issues versus other issues.   In other words, I wonder if it could be quantified in some way.   For example, go back through the last ten reviews and categorize and quantify blockers that required the CSP to resolve:\r\n* Boundary diagram incompleteness\r\n* Insufficient evidence for a particular control or family\r\n* SSP incompleteness for a particular section\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "@kyhu65867 @cybersechawk Good call on boundary diagrams.\r\nThere are a bunch of concerns here:\r\na- As a 3PAO, I've gone through the FedRAMP gauntlet on boundaries for a RAR, taken my lumps, got the diagram approved (and this was tricky because the CSP has to do the diagram, not the 3PAO, but we have to 'vet it') and moved on.  There's a limit on how many iterations you can go between a 3PAO, CSP, and FedRAMP before everyone gets frustrated and it affects the business relationship.\r\nb- Then, during a full authorization review, the same diagram that passed before gets run through the wringer again.\r\nc- There's so much detail that it's almost impossible to 'pass' a diagram.  There are always updates required.\r\nd- Consistency is key, HOWEVER, it's *hard* to ensure that a given component is: named correctly, on the diagram, in the accompanying narrative, and in any appropriate services list.  In particular, getting a list of all IaaS services for a given offering isn't as obvious as it sounds and the naming is inconsistent.  Particularly when you've got multiple sources:  SSP, assessment interviews, evidence all of which is not always using the same name.  \r\ne- don't get me started on 'sub services' (e.g. VPC is the service, but then VPC peering is a subservice... there was an issue a year or two ago about VPC Peering not being deemed an 'authorized service' although there was no way to know/find that.  Everyone assumed it was under the VPC umbrella.  It got worked out, but not without some hoop jumping.\r\n\r\nI've created a boundary diagram checklist which has:  mandatory elements, and then generally scores things with 90% being a pass.  Is there such thing as a diagram markup language of sorts, where you enter in a standard set of components/structures and it generates the  diagram.  That would be easily parsable through automation, guarantee uniform look and feel, and have an objective standard without subjectivity applied.\r\n",

          "body": "Talk about opening a can of worms. Once we are in the automating mode, maybe we can come up with (or there is probably already one out there) a tool that can crawl through the network looking for the \"BD KSIs\". We could at least use that as a baseline. Also with most CSP living in one of the 3 big IaaSs starting with a trusted baseline architecture  may also be very helpful for those CSPs that are SaaS and  always and keep getting hung up on the build within the infrastructure.

          "body": "One of our main goals for FedRAMP 20x is to eliminate costly activities that provide little benefit. In any system or documentation, the purpose of diagrams should be to help clarify critical information. In my experience as both a CSP and an Agency CISO the boundary diagrams rarely meet this criteria. I'm interested to know if anyone who is already using Infrastructure/Compliance as Code has found ways to generate useful diagrams automatically based on the data?",
