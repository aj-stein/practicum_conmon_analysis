# Post

**How do you plan to validate and show automated evidence for KSI-3IR-5 "Implement zero trust design principles"?** There is a lot that can go into implementing a ZTA that could be shown as evidence for this KSI (RBAC, segmentation of network and at runtime environment, etc). Because this KSI is in the **Third Party Information Resources (3IR)** family it seems to me the focus is on how zero trust principles have been adopted to not inherently trust third party software/tools. What ideas do you have for how this KSI can be demonstrated through machine readable, automated evidence? 

My initial ideas: 
- IAM policy JSON showing strict least privilege for SAML/OpenID connected 3rd party or machine accounts (e.g. only permission to needed resources). 
- Terraform or K8s YAML manifest defining network segmentation (firewall rules, scoped 3rd party access, etc).

Looking forward to hearing additional ideas.

How do you see the network segmentation as assessable? I am very curious how you would see that working with some more detail because segmentation just because with the "three-tier architecture" has been common and the real power and paradigm shift of it in the context of ZTA/ZTNA is dynamic segmentation or at least using segments based on logical policy decisions. From look at just the data, how would you know you are doing it right and FedRAMP would know the difference between the former and the latter when assessing?

Same!

Good question @aj-stein-gsa I was thinking you’d run `kubectl get networkpolicy -o yaml` and show  
1. That namespaces are used and implement explicit ingress/egress policies based on the namespace instead of allowing 0.0.0.0/0.
2. K8s Ingress Controller is used to manage north/south traffic.
3. K8s match labels are used to identify east/west traffic. 
4. A Service Mesh to make sure certificates are rotated and provide some ZTA east/west between the internal microservices would also be nice to see.

The evidence above would show network segments "based on logical policy decisions” but doesn’t provide the dynamic segregation that you mention as the real shift behind ZTNA. I believe OPA/Gatekeeper or similar tools can help there but I’m not too familiar with those. 

Tools to potentially assess "good/compliant architecture"
- Kyverno
- OPA/Gatekeeper
- Kubewarden
- Falco or another IDS is nice to have but is responsive/alerting not preventative so I don't think that's what we're looking for with this KSI

I definitely don't have all the answers here and am curious to hear how others would approach this.

A ZTNA K8s network policy YAML might look something like this:   
```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: zta-web-app-policy
  namespace: example-app
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web-app
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
  ingress:
    - from:
        # Only allow ingress from ingress controller by namespace and pod labels
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              name: ingress
          podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: ingress-controller
      ports:
        - port: 443
          protocol: TCP
  egress:
    - to:
        # Allow egress to specific internal API
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              name: example-api
          podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: internal-api
      ports:
        - port: 443
          protocol: TCP
    - to:
        # Allow DNS resolution to kube-dns
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              name: kube-system
          podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              k8s-app: kube-dns
      ports:
        - port: 53
          protocol: UDP
        - port: 53
          protocol: TCP
```

Fair enough, @iteuscher. Maybe it doesn't have to be 100% dynamic, but it cannot necessarily be completely static either, that's the key takeaway from my perspectivre.

For example, [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/zero_trust_maturity_model_v2_508.pdf), the Cloud Security Alliance (full disclosure for transparency and not an endorsement: I did minorly contribute to the CCZT exam materials so I shouldn't cite cite them anyway 😆 ), and the Department of Defense get into depth about that. The context seems important to the zero trust dimension of it. I will focus on this bit.

To point out my personal thought process on this (and it is not a formal opinion or something FedRAMP has explicit guidance on), if we consider the below, network addresses, IP ranges, and labels that generally allow "[all] north/south" or "[all] east/west traffic" as the kind of thing, by virtue of the manifest example, is restrictive and limits network access. However, I would interpret that as contrary to the intended ZT and ZTNA goals because it is permanently and only that if we talk about what is just present in the example.

Two major aspects of zero-trust are using signals to make authorization decisions and having granular role based permissions. I would look for evidence of these and other zero-trust best practices. This could include application level code, firewall rules, as well as configuration settings from Policy Decision Points (PDPs), the Policy Information Points (PIPs), and the Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs)
