We migrated relevant posts to the consolidated board, so visiting an old thread will redirect you to the new location.\r\n\r\nIf we did not move a particular post, and you feel it is still relevant, we encourage you to reach out or just [start a new post at github.com/FedRAMP/community](https://github.com/FedRAMP/community/discussions/new/choose) for that topic. As always, thank you for participation and feedback!",
