  "body": "**How do you plan to validate and show automated evidence for KSI-3IR-5 \"Implement zero trust design principles\"?** There is a lot that can go into implementing a ZTA that could be shown as evidence for this KSI (RBAC, segmentation of network and at runtime environment, etc). Because this KSI is in the **Third Party Information Resources (3IR)** family it seems to me the focus is on how zero trust principles have been adopted to not inherently trust third party software/tools. What ideas do you have for how this KSI can be demonstrated through machine readable, automated evidence? \r\n\r\nMy initial ideas: \r\n- IAM policy JSON showing strict least privilege for SAML/OpenID connected 3rd party or machine accounts (e.g. only permission to needed resources). \r\n- Terraform or K8s YAML manifest defining network segmentation (firewall rules, scoped 3rd party access, etc).\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing additional ideas. \r\n-- Isaac Teuscher (Paramify)",

I am very curious how you would see that working with some more detail because segmentation just because with the \"three-tier architecture\" has been common and the real power and paradigm shift of it in the context of ZTA/ZTNA is dynamic segmentation or at least using segments based on logical policy decisions. From look at just the data, how would you know you are doing it right and FedRAMP would know the difference between the former and the latter when assessing?\r\n \r\n> Looking forward to hearing additional ideas. -- Isaac Teuscher (Paramify)\r\n\r\nSame!\r\n",

Maybe it doesn't have to be 100% dynamic, but it cannot necessarily be completely static either, that's the key takeaway from my perspectivre.\r\n\r\nFor example, [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/zero_trust_maturity_model_v2_508.pdf), the Cloud Security Alliance (full disclosure for transparency and not an endorsement: I did minorly contribute to the CCZT exam materials so I shouldn't cite cite them anyway \ud83d\ude06 ), and the Department of Defense get into depth about that. The context seems important to the zero trust dimension of it. I will focus on this bit.\r\n\r\n> K8s Ingress Controller is used to manage north/south traffic.\r\n> K8s match labels are used to identify east/west traffic.\r\n\r\nTo point out my personal thought process on this (and it is not a formal opinion or something FedRAMP has explicit guidance on), if we consider the below, network addresses, IP ranges, and labels that generally allow \"[all] north/south\" or \"[all] east/west traffic\" as the kind of thing, by virtue of the manifest example, is restrictive and limits network access. However, I would interpret that as contrary to the intended ZT and ZTNA goals because it is permanently and only that if we talk about what is just present in the example.",
