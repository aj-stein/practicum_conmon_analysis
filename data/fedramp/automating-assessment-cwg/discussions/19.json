I would say 100% of CSPs (who have asked for help) have silos of incomplete knowledge - but are lacking coordination and consistency. \r\n\r\n100% find new fixes/controls/enhancements during the FedRAMP process that they then back-port to their commercial environments.

I imagine your statement about \"CSPs knowing how best to secure their own systems\" is coming from an advisory perspective and not from that of a 3PAO assessor.

From what I have seen, the CSP/advisor personnel will know more about enacting security implementation and technologies whereas the 3PAO personnel will be more familiar with how to get a SME to show the screen/evidence they want. Additionally, the 3PAO personnel will usually know less about one specific tool but know something about more tools since they see more systems/organizations using a variety of tools. The 3PAO personnel would also know more about what FedRAMP PMO would have issues with which I guess wouldn't be as relevant anymore.",

We don't _want_ too many people in the pilot tbh, gotta do this incrementally. It'll grow fast if it works.\r\n\r\n> I worry about the legal requirements of 800-53 (e.g. FISMA)\r\n\r\nFedRAMP is developing this process to be _consistent_ with NIST standards to meet legal requirements. FedRAMP has a fair bit of additional legal authority here for setting a standard that is accepted by agencies as long as it meets that consistency requirement. We'll navigate this on the gov side.\r\n\r\n",
